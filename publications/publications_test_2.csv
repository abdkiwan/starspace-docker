__label__sciMet_Optics , We demonstrate a sliding-frequency mode-locked ( SFM ) erbium fiber laser generating 20 ps pulses with center wavelengths rapidly sweeping across a spectral range of 50 nm . Excess optical nonlinearity in the laser cavity leads to multipulsing , with a tendency to tight pulse bunching ( <3 ns ) at the fundamental cavity frequency of 25 MHz . The addition of a parallel optical delay line , with a path difference equal to a rational fraction of the cavity length , distributes the pulses uniformly across the entire cavity and achieves a harmonic SFM up to 1 GHz . The result establishes cavity nonlinearity as a critical design parameter for picosecond wavelength-swept lasers . Harmonic mode locking in a sliding-frequency fiber laser . 
__label__sciMet_Applied_Physics , We present a new field-extrema hysteresis loss model ( FHM ) for high-frequency ferrimagnetic materials , along with a parameter identification procedure . The model does not involve solving an ordinary differential equation ( ODE ) and is asymmetric in that it works well under dc bias conditions . In the proposed model , the loss calculations are based on the extrema values of the fields . The model includes the effects of magnetic saturation as well as frequency effects . The model is comparable in accuracy to the ODE-based Jiles-Atherton model , but retains the convenience and computational efficiency of an empirical model . We demonstrate a procedure to characterize the model parameters using the Jiles-Atherton model . We compare magnetic hysteresis loss calculated by our new model with a full time-domain solution , as well as an empirical model , for a sample high-frequency ferrite . We demonstrate the use of the model , and validate the model , by calculating magnetic loss in an EI core inductor operating as the filter inductor in a buck converter . The model and identification procedure are being endorsed as a useful framework for computing magnetic loss in the context of automated magnetic device design .

__label__sciMet_Physical_Chemistry , The effect of free radicals obtained in hydroxyl and cerium ( IV ) -nitrilotriacetic acid free radical generating systems on contractile proteins ( actin , myosin and their complexes in glycerinated muscle fibres ) was studied using differential scanning calorimetry and spin trapping electron paramagnetic resonance technique . The analysis of spectra showed that selective attack of thiol groups – Cys-257 and Cys-374 residues of actin , and among others Cys-707 residue of myosin – and random attack of sidechains of the main proteins of muscle tissue produced structural and functional changes , which affected the ATP hydrolysis cycle and very likely the dynamics of actin . The melting curves obtained on protein systems support the view that global conformational changes accompany the local damage of free radicals .

__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , The pea mitochondrial genome contains a truncated rps7 gene lacking ca . 40 codons at its 5′ terminus . This single-copy sequence is immediately downstream of and slightly overlapping an actively transcribed and edited reading frame of 744 bp ( designated ccb248 ) homologous to the bacterial helC gene which encodes a subunit of the ABC-type heme transporter involved in cytochrome c biogenesis . This region of mitochondrial DNA appears recombinogenic , and the carboxy-termini of helC-type proteins are predicted to vary in sequence and length among plants . Sequences corresponding to the 5′ coding region of rps7 were not detected elsewhere in the pea mitochondrial genome using wheat rps7 probes , and only a very short internal rps7 segment was observed in soybean mitochondrial DNA . The presence of rps7-homologous sequences in the nuclear genomes of pea and soybean is consistent with the recent transfer of a functional mitochondrial rps7 gene to the nucleus in certain plant lineages . The S7 ribosomal protein gene is truncated and overlaps a cytochrome c biogenesis gene in pea mitochondria

__label__sciMet_Biomedical_Engineering , Human adipose-derived stem cells ( hASC ) exhibit multilineage differentiation potential with lineage specification that is dictated by both the chemical and mechanical stimuli to which they are exposed . We have previously shown that 10% cyclic tensile strain increases hASC osteogenesis and cell-mediated calcium accretion . We have also recently shown that primary cilia are present on hASC and that chemically-induced lineage specification of hASC concurrently results in length and conformation changes of the primary cilia . Further , we have observed cilia length changes in hASC cultured within a collagen I gel in response to 10% cyclic tensile strain . We therefore hypothesize that primary cilia may play a key mechanotransduction role for hASC exposed to tensile strain . The goal of this study was to use finite element analysis ( FEA ) to determine strains occurring within the ciliary membrane in response to 10% tensile strain applied parallel , or perpendicular , to cilia orientation . To elucidate the mechanical environment experienced by the cilium , several lengths were modeled and evaluated based on cilia lengths measured on hASC grown under varied culture conditions . Principal tensile strains in both hASC and ciliary membranes were calculated using FEA , and the magnitude and location of maximum principal tensile strain determined . We found that maximum principal tensile strain was concentrated at the base of the cilium . In the linear elastic model , applying strain perpendicular to the cilium resulted in maximum strains within the ciliary membrane from 150% to 200% , while applying strain parallel to the cilium resulted in much higher strains , approximately 400% . In the hyperelastic model , applying strain perpendicular to the cilium resulted in maximum strains within the ciliary membrane around 30% , while applying strain parallel to the cilium resulted in much higher strains ranging from 50% to 70% . Interestingly , FEA results indicated that primary cilium length was not directly related to ciliary membrane strain . Rather , it appears that cilium orientation may be more important than cilium length in determining sensitivity of hASC to tensile strain . This is the first study to model the effects of tensile strain on the primary cilium and provides newfound insight into the potential role of the primary cilium as a mechanosensor , particularly in tensile strain and potentially a multitude of other mechanical stimuli beyond fluid shear .

__label__sciMet_Optics , An all-solid-state laser transmitter for a water-vapor and temperature differential absorption lidar ( DIAL ) system in the near infrared is introduced . The laser system is based on a master-slave configuration . As the slave laser a Q-switched unidirectional alexandrite ring laser is used , which is injection seeded by the master laser , a cw Ti sapphire ring laser . It is demonstrated that this laser system has , what is to my knowledge , the highest frequency stability ( 15 MHz rms ) , narrowest bandwidth ( <40 MHz ) , and highest spectral purity ( >99 . 99% ) of all the laser transmitters developed to date in the near infrared . These specifications fulfill the requirements for water-vapor measurements with an error caused by laser properties of <5% and temperature measurements with an error caused by laser properties of <1 K in the whole troposphere . The specifications are maintained during long-term operation in the field . The single-mode operation of this laser system makes the narrow-band detection of the DIAL backscatter signal possible . Thus the system has the potential to be used for accurate temperature measurements and for simultaneous DIAL and Doppler wind measurements .

__label__sciMet_Nuclear_&_Particles_Physics , A bstractThis article presents a systematic study of critical points for the SL ( 8 , $ \mathbb{R} $ ) -type gauging in four dimensional maximal gauged supergravity . We determine all the possible vacua for which the origin of the moduli space becomes a critical point via SL ( 8 , $ \mathbb{R} $ ) transformations . We formulate a new tool which enables us to find analytically the mass spectrum of the corresponding vacua in terms of eigenvalues of the embedding tensor . When the cosmological constant is nonvanishing , it turns out that many vacua obtained by the dyonic embedding admit a single deformation parameter of the theory , in agreement with the results of the recent paper by Dall’Agata , Inverso and Trigiante [1] . Nevertheless , it is shown that the resulting mass spectrum is independent of the deformation parameter and can be classified according to the unbroken gauge symmetry at the vacua , rather than the underlying gauging . We also show that the generic Minkowski vacua exhibit instability . Classification and stability of vacua in maximal gauged supergravity
__label__sciMet_Networking_&_Telecommunications , We study the frequency-selective broadcast channel with confidential messages ( BCC ) where the transmitter sends a confidential message to receiver 1 and a common message to receivers 1 and 2 . In the case of a block transmission of symbols followed by a guard interval of symbols , the frequency-selective channel can be modeled as a Toeplitz matrix . For this special type of multiple-input multiple-output channels , we propose a practical Vandermonde precoding that projects the confidential messages in the null space of the channel seen by receiver 2 while superposing the common message . For this scheme , we provide the achievable rate region and characterize the optimal covariance for some special cases of interest . Interestingly , the proposed scheme can be applied to other multiuser scenarios such as the -user frequency-selective BCC with confidential messages and the two-user frequency-selective BCC with two confidential messages . For each scenario , we provide the secrecy degree of freedom ( s . d . o . f . ) region of the corresponding channel and prove the optimality of the Vandermonde precoding . One of the appealing features of the proposed scheme is that it does not require any specific secrecy encoding technique but can be applied on top of any existing powerful encoding schemes .

__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , We describe a discontinuous method for the measurement of catalase using the Ferrous Oxidation in Xylenol orange ( FOX ) assay . Samples containing catalase are incubated with H2O2 for varying time intervals prior to rapid mixing of aliquots of the incubation mixtures with FOX reagent , which measures residual H2O2 . Absorbance is then read at 560 nm after 30-min incubation at room temperature . Decay of H2O2 is proportional to catalase activity in the original sample . An adaptation of the method involves exposure of intact cells to H2O2-generating systems in the presence of aminotriazole . The extent of catalase inactivation allows estimates of total H2O2 accumulation within the cell .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , PurposeDicyandiamide ( DCD ) has been used commercially in New Zealand to reduce nitrate leaching and N2O emissions in grazed pastures . However , there is a lack of information in the literature on the optimum rate of DCD to achieve the environmental benefits while at the same time reducing the cost of the technology . The objective of this study was to determine the effect of DCD application rate on its effectiveness to inhibit ammonia oxidizer growth and nitrification rate in a grazed pasture soil . Materials and methodsThe soil was a Templeton silt loam ( Immature Pallic Soil Udic Haplustepts ) collected from Lincoln University Research Dairy Farm with a mixed pasture consisting of perennial ryegrass ( Lolium perenne L . ) and white clover ( Trifolium repens L . ) and was incubated alone ( control ) or with cow urine at 700 kg N/ha with 6 rates of DCD [0 , 2 . 5 , 5 , 7 . 5 , 10 ( applied twice ) , 15 and 20 kg/ha] in incubation vessels . The incubation vessels were placed randomly in an incubator with a constant temperature of 12 °C . During 112 days of incubation , soil subsamples were taken at different time intervals to measure the concentrations of NO3−-N and NH4+-N and the amoA gene copy numbers of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria ( AOB ) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea ( AOA ) . Results and discussionDCD applied at all the different rates inhibited nitrification in urine-treated soils , but the effectiveness increased with DCD application rate . In addition , AOB growth and the amounts of nitrate-N in the soil were significantly related to the application rate of DCD . However , AOA population abundance showed no relationship to the application rate of DCD . The DCD rate at which the AOB growth rate and nitrate-N concentration were halved ( effective dosage that causes 50 % reduction in nitrification rate , or ED50 ) was about 10 kg DCD/ha . ConclusionsThese results suggest that DCD applied at relatively low rates still slowed down the nitrification rate , and the current recommended rate of 10 kg DCD/ha for DCD use in New Zealand grazed pastures would result in a 50 % reduction in nitrification rate in this soil . The actual rate of DCD application used would depend on the cost of the product and the environmental and agronomic benefits that would result from its use .

__label__sciMet_Networking_&_Telecommunications , Measurement is a required process in high performance networks for efficient quality-of-service ( QoS ) provisioning and service verification . Active measurement is an attractive approach because the measurement traffic injected into the network can be controlled and the measurement tasks can be distributed throughout the network . However , the execution of measurement tasks in common parts of a network may face contention for resources , such as computational power , memory , and link bandwidth . This contention could jeopardize measurement accuracy and affect network services . This contention for limited resources defines a conflict between measurement tasks . Furthermore , we consider two sets of measurement tasks , those used to monitor network state periodically , called periodic tasks , and those for casual measurements issued as needed , called on-demand measurement tasks . In this paper , we propose a novel scheduling scheme to resolve contention for resources of both periodic and on-demand measurement tasks from graph coloring perspective , called ascending order of the sum of clique number and degree of tasks . The scheme selects tasks according to the ascending order of the sum of clique number and conflict task degree in a conflict graph and allows concurrent execution of multiple measurement tasks for high resource utilization . The scheme decreases the average waiting time of all tasks in periodic measurement tasks scheduling . For on-demand measurement tasks , the proposed scheme minimizes the waiting time of inserted on-demand tasks while keeping time space utilization high . In other words , the total time spent on finishing all the tasks is shortened . We evaluate our proposed schemes under different measurement task assignment scenarios through computer simulations , and compare the performance of this scheme with others that also allow concurrent task execution . The simulation results show that the proposed scheme produces effective contention resolution and low execution delays . Task-execution scheduling schemes for network measurement and monitoring

__label__sciMet_Ecology , BackgroundDespite the two-fold cost of sex , most of the higher animals reproduce sexually . The advantage of sex has been suggested to be its ability , through recombination , to generate greater genetic diversity than asexuality , thus enhancing adaptation in a changing environment . We studied the genetic diversity and the population structure of three closely related species of bag worm moths two strictly sexual ( Dahlica charlottae and Siederia rupicolella ) and one strictly asexual ( D . fennicella ) . These species compete for the same resources and share the same parasitoids . ResultsAllelic richness was comparable between the sexual species but it was higher than in the asexual species . All species showed high heterozygote deficiency and a large variation was observed among FIS values across loci and populations . Large genetic differentiation was observed between populations confirming the poor dispersal ability of these species . The asexual species showed lower genotype diversity than the sexual species . Nevertheless , genotype diversity was high in all asexual populations . ConclusionThe three different species show a similar population structure characterised by high genetic differentiation among populations and low dispersal . Most of the populations showed high heterozygote deficiency likely due to the presence of null alleles at most of the loci and/or to the Wahlund effect . Although the parthenogenetic D . fennicella shows reduced genetic diversity compared to the sexual species , it still shows surprisingly high genotype diversity . While we can not totally rule out the presence of cryptic sex , would explain this high genotype diversity , we never observed sex in the parthenogenetic D . fennicella , nor was there any other evidence of this . Alternatively , a non-clonal parthenogenetic reproduction , such as automictic thelytoky , could explain the high genotypic diversity observed in D . fennicella .

__label__sciMet_Fluids_&_Plasmas , We study how nonlinear delayed-feedback in the Ikeda model can induce solitary impulses , i . e . , dissipative solitons . The states are clearly identified in a virtual space-time representation of the equations with delay , and we find that conditions for their appearance are bistability of a nonlinear function and negative character of the delayed feedback . Both dark and bright solitons are identified in numerical simulations and physical electronic experiment , showing an excellent qualitative correspondence and proving thereby the robustness of the phenomenon . Along with single spiking solitons , a variety of compound soliton-based structures is obtained in a wide parameter region on the route from the regular dynamics ( two quiescent states ) to developed spatiotemporal chaos . The number of coexisting soliton-based states is fast growing with delay , which can open new perspectives in the context of information storage .

__label__sciMet_Artificial_Intelligence_&_Image_Processing , __label__KEYWORDS_Bayesian_inference , AbstractProbabilistic generative models work in many applications of image analysis and speech recognition . In general , there is an observation vector $$ \vec y $$ and a state vector $$ \vec x $$ , and a joint dependency structure among them . The object of interest is , given $$ \vec y $$ , the most likely configuration $$ \vec x_{MAP} $$ and its posterior distribution . In practice , the exact value of the posterior probability of $$ \vec x_{MAP} $$ is hard to obtain , especially when there is a large number of observed variables . Here we analyze the distribution of posterior probabilities of $$ \vec x_{MAP} $$ when there are N = 200–1000 observations . We used a probabilistic model with simple linear dependency structure in which the exact value of the posterior probability of $$ \vec x_{MAP} $$ is obtainable . Computer experiments show that even identical models generate a variety of posterior distributions , which suggest difficulties in understanding the meaning of posterior probability . Finally , by computing $$ P ( \vec x * |\vec y ) $$’s where $$ \vec x $$*’s are neighbors of $$ \vec x_{MAP} $$ , we propose a method of knowing whether the $$ \vec x_{MAP} $$ is reliable even when the posterior probability $$ P ( \vec x_{MAP} |\vec y ) $$ is small .

__label__sciMet_Evolutionary_Biology , In the RNA world hypothesis , RNA ( -like ) self-replicators are suggested as the central player of prebiotic evolution . However , there is a serious problem in the evolution of complexity in such replicators , i . e . , the problem of parasites . Parasites , which are replicated by catalytic replicators ( catalysts ) , but do not replicate the others , can destroy a whole replicator system by exploitation . Recently , a theoretical study underlined complex formation between replicators—an often neglected but realistic process—as a stabilizing factor in a replicator system by demonstrating that complex formation can shift the viable range of diffusion intensity to higher values . In the current study , we extend the previous study of complex formation . Firstly , by investigating a well-mixed replicator system , we establish that complex formation gives parasites an implicit advantage over catalysts , which makes the system significantly more vulnerable to parasites . Secondly , by investigating a spatially extended replicator system , we show that the formation of traveling wave patterns plays a crucial role in the stability of the system against parasites , and that because of this the effect of complex formation is not straightforward i . e . , whether complex formation stabilizes or destabilizes the spatial system is a complex function of other parameters . We give a detailed analysis of the spatial system by considering the pattern dynamics of waves . Furthermore , we investigate the effect of deleterious mutations . Surprisingly , high mutation rates can weaken the exploitation of the catalyst by the parasite .

__label__sciMet_Geological_&_Geomatics_Engineering , The practice of soil treatment using cement and zeolite is an approach that can be widely used in soil stabilization particularly in road construction , as a support layer for shallow foundations , to strengthen slopes , and to prevent sand liquefaction . The present research intends to quantify the impact of both amounts of cement and zeolite , porosity index , porosity/cement and porosity/SiO2 and Al2O3 particles ratio on zeolite cemented sand mixtures by the assessment of unconfined compressive strength ( UCS ) . A program of unconfined compression tests considering three distinct porosity ratio , four cement contents ( 2 , 4 , 6 and 8% ) and six different percent of cement replacement by zeolite ( 0 , 10 , 30 , 50 , 70 and 90% ) is performed in this study . Results indicate that cement replaced by zeolite at optimum proportion of 30% , the value of improved UCS of the cement sand specimens due to zeolite and cement chemical properties are exploited . Increasing cement content and porosity of the compacted mixture , the efficiency of using zeolite rises . In this paper , it has been shown that for the zeolite–cement–sand mixtures , UCS increases via cement content ( C ) raise and porosity ( η ) reduction and a power function is well-adapted to fit both UCS-C and UCS-η . Finally , key parameter SiO2 and Al2O3 particles as active particles ( AP ) introduced and six UCS-AP diagrams are drawn , any of which is traced to a specific amount of zeolite . Afterwards , UCS is plotted against 1/AP and η/AP which is regarded as a controlling parameter of UCS . As a consequence , for each of the zeolite–cement–sand mixtures studied , a target UCS value could be obtained using a specific correlation ( 1 . 5E8 η-1 . 713AP1 . 424 , R2 = 0 . 982 ) by porosity reductions , cement content rises and zeolite variations . This experimental research and key parameter AP will introduce an acceptable description of the mechanical parameters which are extensively used in the subgrade and foundation designs .

__label__sciMet_Artificial_Intelligence_&_Image_Processing , In this article we explore the syntactic and semantic properties of prepositions in the context of the semantic interpretation of nominal phrases and compounds . We investigate the problem based on cross-linguistic evidence from a set of six languages English , Spanish , Italian , French , Portuguese , and Romanian . The focus on English and Romance languages is well motivated . Most of the time , English nominal phrases and compounds translate into constructions of the form N P N in Romance languages , where the P ( preposition ) may vary in ways that correlate with the semantics . Thus , we present empirical observations on the distribution of nominal phrases and compounds and the distribution of their meanings on two different corpora , based on two state-of-the-art classification tag sets Lauer ' s set of eight prepositions and our list of 22 semantic relations . A mapping between the two tag sets is also provided . Furthermore , given a training set of English nominal phrases and compounds along with their translations in the five Romance languages , our algorithm automatically learns classification rules and applies them to unseen test instances for semantic interpretation .

__label__sciMet_Fluids_&_Plasmas , We study the stability of the flow which forms in a plane channel with influx of an incompressible viscous fluid through its porous parallel walls . Under certain assumptions the study of the stability reduces to the solution of modified Orr-Sommerfeld equation accounting for the transverse component of the main-flow velocity . As a result of numerical integration of this equation we find the dependence of the local critical Reynolds number on the blowing Reynolds number R0 , which may be defined by two factors the variation of the longitudinal velocity profile with R0 and the presence of the transverse velocity component . A qualitative comparison is made of the computational results with experimental data on transition from laminar to turbulent flow regimes in channels with porous walls , which confirms that it is necessary to take into account the effect of the transverse component of the main-flow velocity on the main-flow stability in the problem in question . Flows in channels with porous walls are of interest for hydrodynamic stability theory in view of the fact that they can be described by the exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations by analogy with the known Poiseuille and Couette flows . However , in contrast with the latter , the flows in channels with porous walls ( studies in [1] , for example ) will be nonparallel . The theory of hydrodynamic stability of parallel flows has frequently been applied to nonparallel flows ( in the boundary layer , for example ) . In so doing the nonparallel nature of the flow has been taken into account only by varying the longitudinal velocity component profiles . A study was made in [2 , 3] of the effect of the transverse component of the main flow on its stability . In the case of the boundary layer in a compressible gas , a considerable influence of the transverse velocity component on the critical Reynolds number was found in [2] and confirmed experimentally . A strong influence of the transverse velocity component on the instability region was also found in [3] in a study of the flow stability in a boundary layer with suction for an incompressible fluid .

__label__sciMet_Medical_Informatics , A two-part study was designed to test the hypothesis that sufficient information is available from a modern hematology analyzer ( the Coulter STKS ) to reach a reliable intermediate conclusion which can be used as input to the next decision-making level in the design of a high-performance expert system for hematology diagnosis . In phase one , we analyzed the performance of three probabilistic systems ( using Bayes ' rule ) which interpret STKS data a control system which took the traditional approach of classifying cases into specific diagnoses , and two test systems which were designed to reach only an intermediate conclusion but not a final diagnosis . One of the test systems classified cases into textbook categories of disease and the other utilized defined diagnostic patterns . The systems were tested with 150 cases . The pattern approach ranked the correct choice first in 141 of 150 cases ( 94% ) . In phase two , we abandoned Bayes ' rule , reformulated the pattern approach into a heuristic classification system , and tested its reliability on 820 cases .

__label__sciMet_Evolutionary_Biology , Seagrass meadows are able to store significant amounts of organic carbon in their underlying sediment , but global estimates are uncertain partly owing to spatio-temporal heterogeneity between and within areas and species . In order to provide robust estimates , there is a need to better understand the fate of , and mechanisms behind , organic carbon storage . In this observational study , we analyse a suite of biotic and abiotic parameters in sediment cores from 47 different eelgrass ( Zostera marina ) beds spanning the distributional range of the Northern Hemisphere . Depth profiles of particulate organic carbon ( POC ) revealed three patterns of vertical distribution where POC either increased , decreased or showed no pattern with sediment depth . These categories exhibited distinct profiles of δ13C and C N ratios , where high POC profiles had a proportionally larger storage of eelgrass-derived material whereas low POC profiles were dominated by phytoplanktonic and macroalgal material . However , high POC did not always translate into high carbon density . Nevertheless , this large-scale dataset provides evidence that the variability in organic matter source in response to natural and anthropogenic environmental changes affects the potential role of eelgrass beds as POC sinks , particularly where eelgrass decline is observed . Variation of carbon contents in eelgrass ( Zostera marina ) sediments implied from depth profiles

We introduce a powerful new method for calculating differential distributions in hard scattering processes .

__label__sciMet_General_Physics , Coherent , large-scale dynamics in many nonequilibrium physical , biological , or information transport networks are driven by small-scale local energy input . Here , we introduce and explore an analytically tractable nonlinear model for compressible active flow networks . In contrast to thermally driven systems , we find that active friction selects discrete states with a limited number of oscillation modes activated at distinct fixed amplitudes . Using perturbation theory , we systematically predict the stationary states of noisy networks and find good agreement with a Bayesian state estimation based on a hidden Markov model applied to simulated time series data . Our results suggest that the macroscopic response of active network structures , from actomyosin force networks to cytoplasmic flows , can be dominated by a significantly reduced number of modes , in contrast to energy equipartition in thermal equilibrium . The model is also well suited to study topological sound modes and spectral band gaps in active matter . Mode Selection in Compressible Active Flow Networks .

__label__sciMet_Computation_Theory_&_Mathematics , Abstract A sequence of k-connected matroids N0 , N1 , … , Nm is called a k-chain , from N0 to Nm , if Ni−1 is a minor of Ni ( i=1 , … , m ) this chain is said to have gap t = max {|E ( Ni ) | − |E ( Ni−1 ) | i = 1 , … , m} . Chains of gap 1 are said to be dense . If M and N are 3-connected matroids , M is not a wheel or whirl , |E ( N ) | ⩾ 4 and N is a minor of M , then there is a dense 3-chain from N′ to M where N′ is isomorphic to N . For graphs this is a theorem of Negami , and for matroids a theorem of Seymour and Tan . Truemper has proved that for M and N 3-connected and N a minor of M , if we do not allow the insertion of an isomorphic copy for N , then there is always a 3-chain from N to M of gap at most 3 . We investigate the structure of these chains , and show that if N has no circuits or cocircuits with 3 or fewer elements , then there is a 3-chain of gap at most 2 . On chains of 3-connected matroids
__label__sciMet_Polymers , Before discussing the specific applications of this process into large parts , it is necessary for us to speak on the specific technology that is represented in this process . We should first define this process in terms of two similar processes that are very prevalent in the industry today . In the Farrel process , offered on Farrel and GKN Windsor Machines , we have a significantly different cycle system than is usual in low pressure structural foam processes . In a low pressure structural foam process , the mold is partially filled with the resin blowing agent mixture , which is then allowed to expand to fill the volume of the cavity . In the Farrel High Pressure Structural Foam Process , the material is packed out into the tool at a reduced volume . Then the tool is expanded to allow the blowing agent to complete the action of foaming . High pressure structural foam therefore involves filling a mold to its complete volume , then increasing that volume to reduce the density . The design and production of high pressule structUl al foam parts result from this concept attempting to &dquo injection mold&dquo structural foam . The system thelefore utIli7es high clamp pressule , such as in injection molding , but rather slow injection speeds agam , as in injection molding .

__label__sciMet_General_Physics , The approach to equilibrium is studied for long-range quantum Ising models where the interaction strength decays like r ( -α ) at large distances r with an exponent α not exceeding the lattice dimension . For a large class of observables and initial states , the time evolution of expectation values can be calculated . We prove analytically that , at a given instant of time t and for sufficiently large system size N , the expectation value of some observable ( t ) will practically be unchanged from its initial value ( 0 ) . This finding implies that , for large enough N , equilibration effectively occurs on a time scale beyond the experimentally accessible one and will not be observed in practice .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , Environmental pollution arising from electronic waste ( e-waste ) disposal and recycling has received considerable attention in recent years . Treatment , at low temperatures , of e-wastes that contain polyvinylchloride and related polymers can release polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) . Although several studies have reported trace metals and polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) released from e-waste recycling operations , environmental contamination and human exposure to PCDD/Fs from e-waste recycling operations are less well understood . In this study , electronic shredder waste and dust from e-waste facilities , and leaves and surface soil collected in the vicinity of a large scale e-waste recycling facility in Taizhou , Eastern China , were analyzed for total PCDD/ Fs including 2 , 3 , 7 , 8-substituted congeners . We also determined PCDD/Fs in surface agricultural soils from several provinces in China for comparison with soils from e-waste facilities . Concentrations of total PCDD/Fs were high in all of the matrices analyzed and ranged from 30 . 9 to 11400 pg/g for shredder waste , 3460 to 9820 pg/g dry weight for leaves , 2560 to 148000 pg/g dry weight for workshop-floor dust , and 854 to 10200 pg/g dry weight for soils . We also analyzed surface soils from a chemical industrial complex ( a coke-oven plant , a coal-fired power plant , and a chlor-alkali plant ) in Shanghai . Concentrations of total PCDD/Fs in surface soil ( 44 . 5-531 pg/g dry wt ) from the chemical industrial complex were lower than the concentrations found in soils from e-waste recycling plants , but higher than the concentrations found in agricultural soils . Agricultural soils from six cities in China contained low levels ( 3 . 44-33 . 8 pg/g dry wt ) of total PCDD/Fs . Profiles of dioxin toxic equivalents ( TEQs ) of 2 , 3 , 7 , 8-PCDD/Fs in soils from e-waste facilities in Taizhou differed from the profiles found in agricultural soils . The estimated daily intakes of TEQs of PCDD/ Fs via soil/dust ingestion and dermal exposure ( 2 . 3 and 0 . 363 pg TEQ/kg bw/day for children and adults , respectively ) were 2 orders of magnitude higher in people at e-waste recycling facilities than in people at the chemical industrial site ( 0 . 021 and 0 . 0053 pg TEQ/kg bw/day for children and adults , respectively ) , implying greater health risk for humans from dioxin exposures at e-waste recycling facilities . The calculated TEQ exposures for e-waste workers from dust and soil ingestion alone were 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than the exposures from soils in reference locations . Concentrations , profiles , and estimated human exposures for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans from electronic waste recycling facilities and a chemical industrial complex in Eastern China . 
__label__sciMet_General_Chemistry , The insoluble β-cyclodextrin/glutaraldehyde crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone nanofibrous membranes were prepared by electrospinning technique . The membranes were extensively characterized by various techniques including attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ATR-FTIR ) , X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and UV-visible absorption to correlate membrane characteristics with their performance . The adsorption ability of the nanofibrous membranes was tested by performing extraction of Methyl orange ( MO ) dye in water . It was observed that β-cyclodextrin incorporated in polyvinylpyrrolidone provided the characteristics of high adsorption capacity of polyvinylpyrrolidone . Results of sorption experiments show that the nanofibrous membranes exhibited an adsorption rate of more than 95% for MO and the MO absorbent was 39 . 82 mg to per gram of β-cyclodextrin glutaraldehyde ( β-CDXFM ) crosslinked PVP under the optimized experimental conditions .

In 2014 a panel of ACMI fellows debated the following proposition The lack of interaction and collaboration between health IT vendors and academic clinical informatics units is stifling innovation and will continue to have a detrimental effect on the evolution of commercial products . Debaters disagreed on the level of interaction and collaboration between the health IT sector and academia and disagreed on whether and by whom innovation was actually taking place . While collaboration between industry and academia was seen as desirable by all of the debaters , there was an acknowledgment that these groups have notably different roles and responsibilities . There was consensus that a path forward should be found , and that AMIA itself has an important role to play in effecting this . Health IT vendors and the academic community The 2014 ACMI debate

__label__sciMet_Organic_Chemistry , The reaction of amides RSO2-Pro-NHMe with ClCH2SiMe2Cl in the presence of ( Me3Si ) 2NH gave pentacoordinated chlorosilanes RSO2-Pro-N ( Me ) CH2SiMe2Cl with an organosulfonyl group ( R = Me , Ph , 4-ClC6H4 , 4-BrC6H4 , 4-MeC6H4 , and 4-O2NC6H4 ) attached to the proline nitrogen atom . An alternative method for the preparation of these compounds comprises the cyclosilylmethylation of proline methylamide by dimethylchloromethylchlorosilane to give the previously unreported heterocyclic 2-sila-5-piperazinone system in the first step . The bicyclic silacyclane synthesized is 2-sila5-piperazinone condensed with a proline residue . The action of sulfonyl chlorides RSO2Cl leads to cleavage of the sila ring Si–N bond to give the desired chlorosilanes . The hydrolysis of these products , depending on the reaction conditions , gives either silyloxonium chlorides [RSO2-ProN ( Me ) CH2SiMe2OH2]Cl or disiloxanes [RSO2-Pro-N ( Me ) CH2SiMe2]2O . X-ray diffraction structural analysis showed that the silicon atom in the chlorides and silyloxonium chlorides is pentacoordinated due to an intramolecular O → Si bond and has distorted trigonal-bipyrimidal configuration . 29Si NMR spectroscopy showed that the disiloxanes and bicyclic sila-5-piperazinone have a tetracoordinated silicon atom .

__label__sciMet_General_Physics , We have observed an unexpected enhancement of the lower critical field H ( c1 ) ( T ) and the critical current I ( c ) ( T ) deep in the superconducting state below T approximately 0 . 6 K ( T/T ( c ) approximately 0 . 3 ) in the filled skutterudite heavy fermion superconductor PrOs ( 4 ) Sb ( 12 ) . From a comparison of the behavior of H ( c1 ) ( T ) with that of the heavy fermion superconductors U ( 1-x ) Th ( x ) Be ( 13 ) and UPt ( 3 ) , we speculate that the enhancement of H ( c1 ) ( T ) and I ( c ) ( T ) in PrOs ( 4 ) Sb ( 12 ) reflects a transition into another superconducting phase that occurs below T/T ( c ) approximately 0 . 3 . An examination of the literature reveals unexplained anomalies in other physical properties of PrOs ( 4 ) Sb ( 12 ) near T/T ( c ) approximately 0 . 3 that correlate with the features we have observed in H ( c1 ) ( T ) and I ( c ) ( T ) .

__label__sciMet_Biomedical_Engineering , A limitation in the use of hydrophilic polymers as implantable devices is their inherently poor mechanical strength . Using interpenetrating polymer networks ( IPNs ) consisting of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic networks is an effective method of strengthening these polymers . In this work , a series of poly ( dimethyl siloxane ) ( PDMS ) /poly ( acrylic acid ) ( PAAc ) sequential IPNs were synthesized and their properties , including swelling , morphology , and mechanical strength , were investigated . A reinforcing effect of the addition of PAAc to PDMS was observed at a concentration of 20 wt% , where this component had a bimodal size distribution . All of the IPNs exhibited rubbery behavior in the swollen state . Phase inversion in the IPNs occurred at about 60 wt% of PAAc . However , the swelling data showed that the phase inversion in the swollen state occurred at PAAc contents lower than those for dry IPNs . The improved cell behavior , reported in previous works for PDMS/PAAc IPNs with about 20 wt% PAAc , can , in addition to the increased surface wettability , be attributed to the bimodality of PAAc particles size distribution in the IPN . Relationships between the morphology , swelling and mechanical properties of poly ( dimethyl siloxane ) /poly ( acrylic acid ) interpenetrating networks .

__label__sciMet_Software_Engineering , Abstract This paper presents a sufficient linear convexity condition for bivariate spline ( piecewise polynomial ) functions over triangulations . This condition is a natural extension of a sufficient linear convexity condition for polynomials over a triangle . This condition turns out to be highly restrictive in the sense that , in many cases , the only functions satisfying the condition are linear , independent of the degree of the polynomial pieces making up the function . This result implies that certain surface subdivision algorithms necessarily produce surfaces which have the wrong shape . On convexity of piecewise polynomial functions on triangulations

A pre-aging process of the mother gel at 80°C for 24 h before the crystallization was important for the formation of the nanosized zeolites . We have also found that silicalite-1 nanocrystals av . 62 nm in size were formed by the addition of acidic amino acids into the mother gel . The particle size of the zeolites can be controlled ranging from 62 to 530 nm by changing the amount of water , aging process , crystallization time and temperature and the addition of organic molecules .

__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , Soil microorganisms are the primary mediators of organic matter decomposition and humification processes in soil , which represent a critical C flux in the global C cycle . Little is known about how soil microbes regulate carbon cycling including the contribution of their own biomass to stable soil organic matter . A comprehensive understanding of microbial composition is a first step to unraveling microbial regulation of soil humification processes . For this purpose , we isolated 23 microbial strains representing four major groups ( Gram ( + ) bacteria , Gram ( − ) bacteria , Actinobacteria , and Fungi ) from a temperate and a tropical forest soil . The microbial isolates were cultured with uniformly 13C-labeled glucose as the C source such that all biochemical components synthesized from glucose were 13C labeled . This approach enabled field mesocosm experiments on tracking microbial decomposition , while facilitating solution- and solid-state NMR analysis of microbial composition . Polar and lipid extracts of labeled biomass of the four microbial groups from the two forest sites were profiled by 2D NMR methods , including high-resolution heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy and HCCH-total correlation spectroscopy . This 13C labeling approach also enabled the analysis of intact biomass by 2D solid-state 13C–13C correlation spectroscopy . Distinction between microbial groups and sites was observed in the polar and lipophilic metabolite profiles . Dominant differences could also be related to the capacity for lipid β-oxidation or adaptation to desiccation . Solid-state NMR further revealed differential synthetic capacity for glycolipids among groups . This technology coupled with 13C metabolite profiling should facilitate future functional annotation of indigenous microbial genomes . 13C-Isotopomer-based metabolomics of microbial groups isolated from two forest soils

__label__sciMet_Meteorology_&_Atmospheric_Sciences , A global three-dimensional chemical transport model has been used to identify and evaluate possible candidates for the `missing ' surface source required to balance the atmospheric budget of methyl bromide . Both natural and anthropogenic emissions of methyl bromide are `coloured ' in the model , thus allowing the global CH3Br distribution to be broken-down into its source components . These coloured CH3Br tracers are then combined in various ways to create one base-line emission scenario and five further plausible scenarios . The additional emission scenarios are specifically designed to test whether the geographical distribution and seasonal cycles of additional vegetation and/or increased biomass burning emissions are consistent with atmospheric observations of methyl bromide mixing ratios . Due to an imbalance in our current understanding of the methyl bromide budget , simulated CH3Br mixing ratios from the base-line emission scenario are significantly lower than atmospheric measurements . Both the inclusion of a vegetation source in the tropics and a double strength biomass burning source substantially improve the agreement between model simulations and atmospheric measurements compared with the base-line emission scenario . While measurement data provides useful information on global fluxes and regional CH3Br seasonal cycles , small differences between the simulated seasonal cycles of different emission scenarios makes it difficult to distinguish between the relative likelihoods of model scenarios containing a tropical vegetation source or an increased biomass burning source . Further measurements performed in continental mid-to-high northern latitudes , central-southern Africa and South America would be of particular benefit in future attempts to constrain the location and magnitude of the natural terrestrial sources of methyl bromide .

__label__sciMet_Nuclear_&_Particles_Physics , A bstractSpherically symmetric perturbations in AdS-scalar field systems of small amplitude ε approximately periodic on time scales of order 1/ε2 ( in the sense that no significant transfer of energy between the AdS normal modes occurs ) have played an important role in considerations of AdS stability . They are seen as anchors of stability islands where collapse of small perturbations to black holes does not occur . ( This collapse , if it happens , typically develops on time scales of the order 1/ε2 . ) We construct an analytic treatment of the frequency spectra of such quasiperiodic perturbations , paying special attention to the large frequency asymptotics . For the case of a self-interacting ϕ4 scalar field in a non-dynamical AdS background , we arrive at a fairly complete analytic picture involving quasiperiodic spectra with an exponential suppression modulated by a power law at large mode numbers . For the case of dynamical gravity , the structure of the large frequency asymptotics is more complicated . We give analytic explanations for the general qualitative features of quasiperiodic solutions localized around a single mode , in close parallel to our discussion of the probe scalar field , and find numerical evidence for logarithmic modulations in the gravitational quasiperiodic spectra existing on top of the formulas previously reported in the literature .

Miscanthus is a potential source of platform chemicals and bioethanol through fermentation . Miscanthus sinensis ( M . sinensis ) has been found to contain particularly high levels of soluble phenols ( hydroxycinnamates and flavonoids ) which may have application in the nutraceutical , cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries . Here , we describe the first study on the identification and quantification of phenols from the leaf tissue of a bi-parental M . sinensis mapping family . Parents and progeny showed complex profiles of phenols with highly related structures which complicated characterisation of individual phenotypes . Separation of semi-purified extracts by reverse-phase liquid chromatography , coupled with detection by diode array and ESI-MS/MS , enabled distinction of different profiles of phenols . Ten hydroxycinnamates ( O-cinnamoylquinic acids ) and several flavones ( one mono-O-glycosyl flavone , eight mono-C-glycosyl flavones , two di-C-glycosyl flavones , five O-glycosyl-C-glycosyl flavones and nine 2″-O-glycosyl-C-glycosyl flavones ) were identified and quantified in leaf tissue of two hundred progeny and maternal and paternal plants during the seedling stage . Progeny exhibiting high , moderate and low amounts of hydroxycinnamates and flavonoids and both parents were selected and screened at seven months ' growth to determine the abundance of these phenols at their highest biomass and compared with seedlings . Concentrations of phenols generally decreased as leaves matured . Several flavone-glycosides were identified . This technique can be used for rapid screening of plants in a mapping family to identify genotypes with high phenol content to add value in the biorefinery chain . This comparative study provides information on the content of potentially valuable compounds from readily renewable resources and possible biomarkers for identification in breeding programmes .

__label__sciMet_General_Physics , We study the effect of different types of fluctuation on the motion of self-propelled particles in two spatial dimensions . We distinguish between passive and active fluctuations . Passive fluctuations ( e . g . , thermal fluctuations ) are independent of the orientation of the particle . In contrast , active ones point parallel or perpendicular to the time dependent orientation of the particle . We derive analytical expressions for the speed and velocity probability density for a generic model of active Brownian particles , which yields an increased probability of low speeds in the presence of active fluctuations in comparison to the case of purely passive fluctuations . As a consequence , we predict sharply peaked Cartesian velocity probability densities at the origin . Finally , we show that such a behavior may also occur in non-Gaussian active fluctuations and discuss briefly correlations of the fluctuating stochastic forces . Brownian motion with active fluctuations .

When there is an alkyl substituent attached to the 3-N atom in 2 , 4 , 5-trioxopyrrolo[2 , 3-d]pyrimidines , the pyrrole ring readily opens up under the influence of alkali to give 5-hydroxyacetyl-6-amino uracils .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , Disposal of PC monitors and TV sets is a growing problem , with over 40% of the weight of these systems comprised of waste glasses with high Pb ( funnel ) or Ba-Sr concentrations ( panel ) , making them unsuitable for recycling and manufacturing new glass . A possible way to re-use these glasses is in the manufacturing of clay bricks and roof tiles . This possibility was appraised by laboratory simulation of the brickmaking process and technological characterization of unfired and fired products . The recycling of both funnel and panel glasses into clay bodies is technologically feasible , resulting in a substantially reduced plasticity behaviour during shaping-drying ( implying a reduction of mechanical strength ) , and a promotion of sintering during firing . No significant release of Pb , Ba , and Sr was observed during the firing and leaching test for the carbonate-poor body in contrast , some Pb volatilization during firing and Sr leaching were observed for the carbonate-rich body . Additions of 2 wt . % appear to be practicable , while 5 wt . % glass induces unacceptable modifications of technological properties . The recommended amount is within 2 and 4 wt . % , depending on the characteristics of the clay bodies . The main constraint is that the glass must have a particle size below the limit of the pan mills used in brickmaking ( <1mm ) . Recycling PC and TV waste glass in clay bricks and roof tiles .

__label__sciMet_Optics , A refractive index sensor with a free spectral range that is unlimited by neighboring mode spacing ( 10 fold increase with respect to 20 nm of an unmodified ring ) , based on an optical silicon-on-insulator microring resonator patterned with periodically arranged set of gold nanodisks , is presented and numerically verified . It is shown that the particular periodic arrangement of nanodisks selects a single resonance from a wide set of ring resonator modes and removes mode splitting . Extraction of the waveguided electromagnetic energy into evanescent plasmonic modes enhances light-analyte interaction and increases device sensitivity to variation of refractive index up to 176  nm/RIU ( about 2-fold increase compared to the unmodified ring ) , which is useful for sensor applications . Proof of the concept is presented by finite-difference time-domain simulations of a design readily practicable by means of modern nanotechnology .

__label__sciMet_Marine_Biology_&_Hydrobiology , The physical structure of two riffles in a lowland Danish stream was studied and its importance for the composition and density of the macroinvertebrate communities was evaluated . The two riffles were visually assessed to be very similar , but measurements revealed that they differed in overall hydraulic conditions , stability , substratum composition and consolidation . Differences affected abundance of both burrowing and surface dwelling macroinvertebrates . The unstable unconsolidated riffle had higher total macroinvertebrate abundance ( 4137 m−2 vs . 1698 m−2 ) , diptera abundance ( 2329 m−2 vs . 386 m−2 ) and total estimated species richness ( 31 . 7 vs . 28 . 8 ) as well as lower evenness ( 0 . 77 vs . 0 . 83 ) than the compact riffle . Among samples within the unconsolidated riffle , variations in macroinvertebrate communities were related to differences in mean substratum particle size . Here a linear log–log relationship existed between macroinvertebrate abundance , the abundance of EPT taxa and the median particle size ( r2total = 0 . 46 , p = 0 . 002 r2EPT = 0 . 73 , p < 0 . 001 ) . No similar relationships were evident on the consolidated riffle . Moreover , macroinvertebrate communities on the unconsolidated riffle were dominated by species with a high colonising potential . Despite being assessed to the same morphological unit , physical variation between riffles was surprisingly high as the riffles differed substantially with respect to consolidation , substratum heterogeneity and overall hydraulic structure . Macroinvertebrate community structure and composition also differed between riffles despite being drawn from the same species pool . The findings address the question if we use the correct methods and parameters when assessing the macroinvertebrate communities at the scale of the morphological unit .

__label__sciMet_Polymers , Laminin is a heterotrimeric glycoprotein with a key role in the formation and maintenance of the basement membrane architecture and properties , as well as on the modulation of several biological functions , including cell adhesion , migration , differentiation and matrix-mediated signaling . In the central nervous system ( CNS ) laminin is differentially expressed during development and homeostasis , with an impact on the modulation of cell function and fate . Within neurogenic niches , laminin is one of the most important and well described extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins . Specifically , efforts have been made to understand laminin assembly , domain architecture and interaction of its different bioactive domains with cell surface receptors , soluble signaling molecules and ECM proteins , to gain insight into the role of this ECM protein and its receptors on the modulation of neurogenesis , both in homeostasis and during repair . This is also expected to provide a rational basis for the design of biomaterial-based matrices mirroring the biological properties of the basement membrane of neural stem cell niches , for application in neural tissue repair and cell transplantation . This review provides a general overview of laminin structure and domain architecture , as well as the main biological functions mediated by this heterotrimeric glycoprotein .

__label__sciMet_Astronomy_&_Astrophysics , We consider the spatial-temporal properties of the speckle patterns formed when coherent radio waves are scattered by planets . At a speckle diameter of only a few kilometers , the speckle patterns are shown to be displaced in “frozen” form by distances larger than the Earth’s diameter due to the spin-orbital motion i . e . , long-range coherence of the radar field takes place . We estimate the coherence losses of the echo signals from Mercury due to the decorrelation of the patterns , which do not exceed or comparable to 10-4 in order of magnitude for ground-based interferometers . Such small losses imply a high degree of “frozenness” of the speckle pattern everywhere within the Earth , i . e . , on a global scale .

__label__sciMet_Industrial_Engineering_&_Automation , Classical conditioning is a basic learning mechanism in animals and can be found in almost all organisms . If we want to construct robots with abilities matching those of their biological counterparts , this is one of the learning mechanisms that needs to be implemented first . This article describes a computational model of classical conditioning where the goal of learning is assumed to be the prediction of a temporally discounted reward or punishment based on the current stimulus situation . The model is well suited for robotic implementation as it models a number of classical conditioning paradigms and learning in the model is guaranteed to converge with arbitrarily complex stimulus sequences . This is an essential feature once the step is taken beyond the simple laboratory experiment with two or three stimuli to the real world where no such limitations exist . It is also demonstrated how the model can be included in a more complex system that includes various forms of sensory pre-processing and how it can handle reinforcement learning , timing of responses and function as an adaptive world model .

__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , SummaryThe competitive ability of the pollen of wild tomato species ( Solanum pennellii , Lycopersicum hirsutum and L . minutum ) and a cultivar of tomato to affect fertilization at low temperature was investigated . Pollen grains of wild species were mixed with those of the cultivar and pollinated onto the stigma of the cultivar . The number of seedlings resembling the wild species , excluding L . minutum , were significantly higher when the plants were maintained at a low temperature ( 8°–12° C ) than when they were maintained at a normal temperature ( 22°–28° C ) . This indicates that the pollen of S . pennellii and L . hirsutum wild species can compete better with pollen of the cultivar at a low temperature , while there was no change in the competitive ability of L . minutum pollen under these conditions .

The tensor-product parity coding scheme helps to improve efficiency of the parity code while retaining the same level of performance . In this paper , we present two methods for combining a tensor-product parity code with a distance-enhancing constrained code . The first method incorporates a constrained code with unconstrained positions . The second method uses a new technique , which we call word-set partitioning , to achieve a higher code rate relative to the first method . We simulate the performance of several coding systems based upon the two combination methods on a perpendicular recording channel , and we compare their symbol error rates and sector error rates with those of a system that uses only a Reed-Solomon code .

__label__sciMet_Optics , This paper proposes a novel phase-shifting method for fast , accurate , and unambiguous 3D shape measurement . The basic idea is embedding a speckle-like signal in three sinusoidal fringe patterns to eliminate the phase ambiguity , but without reducing the fringe amplitude or frequency . The absolute depth is then recovered through a robust region-wise voting strategy relying on the embedded signal . Using the theoretical minimum of only three images , the proposed method greatly facilitates the application of phase shifting in time-critical conditions . Moreover , the proposed method is resistant to the global illumination effects , as the fringe patterns used are with a single high frequency . Based on the proposed method , we further demonstrate a real-time , high-precision 3D scanning system with an off-the-shelf projector and a commodity camera . Unambiguous 3D measurement from speckle-embedded fringe . 
__label__sciMet_Ecology , The quantity and quality of freshwater resources are now being seriously threatened , partly as a result of extensive worldwide changes in land use , and scientists are often called upon by policy makers and managers to predict the ecological consequences that these alterations will have for stream ecosystems . The effects of the urbanization of stream ecosystems in the United States over the next 20 years are of particular concern . To address this issue , we present a multidisciplinary research agenda designed to improve our forecasting of the effects of land-use change on stream ecosystems . Currently , there are gaps in both our knowledge and the data that make it difficult to link the disparate models used by economists , hydrologists , geomorphologists , and ecologists . We identify a number of points that practitioners in each discipline were not comfortable compromising on—for example , by assuming an average condition for a given variable . We provide five instructive examples of the limitations to our ability to forecast the fate of stream and riverine ecosystems one drawn from each modeling step ( a ) Accurate economic methods to forecast land-use changes over long periods ( such as 20 years ) are not available , especially not at spatially explicit scales ( b ) geographic data are not always available at the appropriate resolution and are not always organized in categories that are hydrologically , ecologically , or economically meaningful ( c ) the relationship between low flows and land use is sometimes hard to establish in anthropogenically affected catchments ( d ) bed mobility , suspended sediment load , and channel form—all of which are important for ecological communities in streams—are difficult to predict and ( e ) species distributions in rivers are not well documented , and the data that do exist are not always publicly available or have not been sampled at accurate scales , making it difficult to model ecological responses to specified levels of environmental change . Meeting these challenges will require both interdisciplinary cooperation and a reviewed commitment to intradisciplinary research in the fields of economics , geography , quantitative spatial analysis , hydrology , geomorphology , and ecology .

__label__sciMet_Artificial_Intelligence_&_Image_Processing , Traditional discriminant analysis ( DA ) methods are usually not amenable to being studied only with a few or even single facial image per subject . The ? fundamental ? reason ? lies in the fact that the traditional DA approaches cannot fully reflect the variations of a query sample with illumination , occlusion and pose variations , especially in the case of small sample size . In this paper , we develop a multi-scale fuzzy sparse discriminant analysis using a local third-order tensor model to perform robust face classification . More specifically , we firstly introduced a local third-order tensor model of face images to exploit a set of multi-scale characteristics of the Ridgelet transform . Secondly , a set of Ridgelet transformed coefficients with respect to each block from a face image are respectively generated . We then merge all these coefficients to form a new representative vector for the image . Lastly , we evaluate the sparse similarity grade between each training sample and class by constructing a sparse similarity metric , and redesign the traditional discriminant criterion that contains considerable fuzzy sparse similarity grades to perform robust classification . Experimental results conducted on a set of well-known face databases demonstrate the merits of the proposed method , especially in the case of insufficient training samples .

__label__sciMet_Geochemistry_&_Geophysics , Deregulated expressions of both c-myc and simian virus 40 large T antigen ( SV40Tag ) are consistent features of lots of tumors . To investigate whether the expression of c-myc and SV40Tag in mouse might help develop a model of human tumor , we generated c-myc transgenics by inserting human c-myc gene into pTRE2 of Tet-On system . We obtained conditional expression of SV40Tag transgenics by the Tet-On system from Yangzhou University . Crossing the c-myc transgenic mouse with the SV40Tag transgenic mice to generate bitransgenics we got double-transgenic mice expressing c-myc and SV40Tag by the Tet-On system . After being treated with doxycycline continuously , single-transgenic SV40Tag mice developed brain tumor infrequently ( 3 of 84 , 3 . 6% ) with a long onset ( 185 d on average ) . In contrast , double-transgenic c-myc/SV40Tag mice developed brain tumor with a short onset ( 96 days on average ) and a 41% brain tumor incidence rate ( 7 of 17 , 41% ) . This tumor was assumed to be medulloblastoma . Our experiments suggest that deregulated expression of c-myc and SV40Tag in brain might generate a mouse model of human brain tumor that recapitulates some features of human medulloblastoma .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , PurposeRecent research has focused on using water treatment residuals ( WTRs ) as cost-effective materials to remove potential environmental contaminants . To better understand and predict how WTRs affect the mobility and retention of nickel ( Ni ) in soils with time , it is crucial that the kinetics and thermodynamics of these reactions be understood . Such information is lacking in the literature and would aid in evaluating the suitability of WTR as a soil amendment for adsorbing Ni contaminant . Accordingly , we focused on investigating the retention of Ni in differing soils and the subsequent influence of WTR application on Ni retention . Materials and methodsTo examine the effects of WTR application on the characteristics of Ni retention , equilibrium , and kinetics , sorption batch experiments were performed on three soils having different properties . The sorption data were applied to the first-order kinetic model , and the Arrhenius equation was used to determine the thermodynamic parameters . Results and discussionThe quantity of Ni sorbed by the soils followed the trend Typic Torrifluvent > Typic Calciorthids > Typic Torripsamment . Soil sorption isotherms shift toward a higher sorption of Ni indicating addition of more sorption sites as a result of WTRs’ application . Data generated at different temperatures for soils and WTR-amended soils fitted well to Freundlich isotherm and first-order kinetic models . The energy of activation ( Ea ) and enthalpy ( ΔH# ) , entropy ( ΔS# ) , and free energy of activation ( ΔG# ) related to Ni sorption were calculated using the Arrhenius equation . The activation energy ( Ea ) values ( 51 . 65–130 . 0 kJ mol−1 ) and the positive ΔH# values characterize Ni sorption process onto the sorbents studied as chemisorption with an endothermic nature . The large negative ΔS# values ( −262 to −290 J mol−1 ) and the large positive ΔG# values ( 88 . 11–89 . 14 kJ mol−1 ) indicate the involvement of an associative mechanism in the Ni sorption process . ConclusionsWTR addition has led to an overall increase in Ni sorption by the amended soils . Such increase in Ni sorption provides evidence that WTR has the potential for land application as a Ni sorbent in soil remediation techniques . The sorption capacity of the soils and WTR-amended soils enhanced with an increase in temperature . Therefore , to truly understand the potential fate and mobility of Ni in the natural environment , temperature , in particular , should be considered .

__label__sciMet_Ecology , Markov models are widely used to describe the dynamics of communities of sessile organisms , because they are easily fitted to field data and provide a rich set of analytical tools . In typical ecological applications , at any point in time , each point in space is in one of a finite set of states ( e . g . , species , empty space ) . The models aim to describe the probabilities of transitions between states . In most Markov models for communities , these transition probabilities are assumed to be independent of state abundances . This assumption is often suspected to be false and is rarely justified explicitly . Here , we start with simple assumptions about the interactions among sessile organisms and derive a model in which transition probabilities depend on the abundance of destination states . This model is formulated in continuous time and is equivalent to a Lotka-Volterra competition model . We fit this model and a variety of alternatives in which transition probabilities do not depend on state abundances to a long-term coral reef data set . The Lotka-Volterra model describes the data much better than all models we consider other than a saturated model ( a model with a separate parameter for each transition at each time interval , which by definition fits the data perfectly ) . Our approach provides a basis for further development of stochastic models of sessile communities , and many of the methods we use are relevant to other types of community . We discuss possible extensions to spatially explicit models . Lotka-Volterra competition models for sessile organisms . 
__label__sciMet_Industrial_Engineering_&_Automation , In this paper , we present a framework for studying folding problems from a motion-planning perspective . The version of the motion-planning problem we consider is that of determining a sequence of motions to transform some configuration of a foldable object ( the start ) into another configuration ( the goal ) . Modeling foldable objects as tree-like multilink objects allows us to apply motion-planning techniques for articulated objects with many degrees of freedom ( many links ) to folding problems . An important feature of this approach is that it not only allows us to study foldability questions , such as , can one object be folded ( or unfolded ) into another object , but it also provides us with another tool for investigating the dynamic folding process itself . The framework proposed here has application to traditional motion-planning areas such as automation and animation , to paper-folding problems studied in computational geometry , and to computational biology problems such as protein folding . Preliminary experimental results with paper folding and the folding of small proteins ( approximately 60 residues ) are quite encouraging .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , Vegetated ( with Kandelia candel seedlings ) and non-vegetated mangrove microcosms were employed to remove pyrene from contaminated sediments , and the effects of adding 6 . 7% humic acid ( HA ) on such removal were investigated . At the end of 6-month treatment , residual pyrene concentrations in surface sediments ( 0-2 cm ) of the contaminated microcosms reduced from an initial 5 . 82 to 0 . 63 microg g ( -1 ) dw , and the reduction was less in HA amended microcosms with the residual pyrene concentration remained at 3 . 12 microg g ( -1 ) dw . The pyrene removal percentages in microcosms with HA amendment were 29% for surface aerobic sediments and 41% for bottom ( anaerobic ) sediments , while the respective removal percentages in microcosms without HA amendment were 89% ( surface sediments ) and 53% ( bottom sediments ) . Microcosms planted with K . candel seedlings had a significantly higher pyrene removal when compared to the non-vegetated ones , and the average removal percentages were 70 . 9% and 61 . 4% , respectively . However , when humic acid was added , no significant difference was found between vegetated and non-vegetated microcosms in pyrene removal , both had less than 40% removal , probably because plant growth in humic acid amended contaminated microcosms , in terms of total biomass , was reduced by 50% . Roots of K . candel could accumulate pyrene from contaminated microcosms , and pyrene concentrations in roots harvested from microcosms with and without humic acid addition were 6 . 01 and 3 . 46 microg g ( -1 ) dw , respectively . These results suggest that the addition of HA to contaminated sediments decreased the mangrove microcosm ' s ability to remove pyrene as pyrene was more tightly bound to the organic matter and plant growth was reduced . Negative effects of humic acid addition on phytoremediation of pyrene-contaminated sediments by mangrove seedlings . 
__label__sciMet_General_Mathematics , AbstractIn this paper , we consider a triple of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence $$ A_i ^{\underrightarrow {d_{GH} }} A , B_i ^{\underrightarrow {d_{GH} }} A $$ and maps fi Ai → Bi converge to a map f A → B , where Ai are compact Alexandrov n-spaces and Bi are compact Riemannian m-manifolds such that the curvature , diameter and volume are suitably bounded ( non-collapsing ) . When f is a submetry , we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the sequence to be stable , that is , for i large , there are homeomorphisms , Ψi Ai → A , Φi Bi → B such that f ∘ Ψi = Φi ∘ fi . When f is an ε-submetry with ε > 0 , we obtain a sufficient condition for the stability in the case that Ai are Riemannian manifolds . Our results generalize the stability/finiteness results on fiber bundles by Riemannian submersions and by submetries . Stability of almost submetries

It turns out that despite the similarity of the two models , they behave rather differently . For type I , the excess interference ( relative to the Poisson case ) increases exponentially in the hard-core distance , while for type II , the gap never exceeds 1 dB .

__label__sciMet_Networking_&_Telecommunications , In time driven applications we are often bound to make a keen compromise between the sampling resolution ( or sampler architecture ) and available resources . This is especially true in WSNs ( Wireless Sensor NetworkS ) , although the complexity of event driven environments present us new opportunities for optimizations . In this paper we propose a multi resolution sampling protocol for event driven WSNs that can dynamically adapt to event signatures and can efficiently schedule resource intensive samplers . The system can monitor the environment by a resource optimized sampler which is only to detect events and not to store or process any samples . When scheduled the high resolution sampler is activated to sample the appropriate physical property of the phenomenon marked by the event , via resolution optimized hardware . Since it takes time to detect an event ( triggered by the signal we already ought to sample ) and to power up the high resolution , resource intensive sampler , we must start the sampling before the signal is detected . This calls for dynamic event forecasting , which is the main feature of the proposed system . Adaptive multiresolution sampling in event-driven WSNs

__label__sciMet_Networking_&_Telecommunications , Previously , we have demonstrated both analytically and experimentally subwavelength imaging using a negative-refractive-index lens made of a periodically L , C loaded transmission line ( TL ) network . This loaded transmission line network has been referred to as the dual TL lens . Here , we consider the limitations on subwavelength imaging imposed by impedance mismatches and the component losses of a practical dual TL lens . Simple expressions for estimating the resolving capability of a dual TL lens are given . It is found that the resolution enhancement of the dual lens is proportional to the quality factor of the series loading capacitors divided by the electrical thickness of the lens . The effective material parameters of the dual TL lens are also derived so that these expressions can be directly related to those of previous studies considering uniform and isotropic left-handed lenses . Finally , the resolving capability of an experimental lens that achieves subwavelength imaging is theoretically predicted . These theoretical predictions are then directly compared to previously reported experimental results . Practical limitations of subwavelength resolution using negative-refractive-index transmission-line lenses

__label__sciMet_General_Physics , We present an effective time approach to predict long and short time rheological behavior of soft glassy materials from experiments carried out over practical time scales . Effective time approach takes advantage of relaxation time dependence on aging time that allows time-aging time superposition even when aging occurs over the experimental time scales . Interestingly , experiments on a variety of soft materials demonstrate that the effective time approach successfully predicts superposition for diverse aging regimes ranging from subaging to hyperaging behaviors . This approach can also be used to predict behavior of any response function in molecular as well as spin glasses . Prediction of long and short time rheological behavior in soft glassy materials .

The phase velocity dispersion and inverse Rayleigh wave decay length in the second order of vanishing with respect to the ratio of the structurally damaged layer thickness to the wavelength have been obtained in an analytical form . For the dispersion and the inverse wave decay length , the long-wave limit has been studied when the wavelength is much larger than the characteristic size of layer inhomogeneity .

__label__sciMet_Applied_Physics , __label__KEYWORDS_quantum_computation , We study the ground-state lifetime ( GSL ) of polaron in a two-dimensional RbCl quantum pseudodot ( QPD ) system by using a variational method of Pekar type ( PTVM ) and the quantum statistical theory . Considering the polaron effect , we derive the dependent relations of the temperature , the electric field , the chemical potential ( CP ) of the two-dimensional electron gas ( TDEG ) , the polaron radius ( PR ) and the zero point ( ZP ) of the pseudoharmonic potential ( PHP ) on the GSL of polaron . The calculated results show that the GSL $$\tau$$τ of polaron will decrease when the CP $$V_{0}$$V0 of the TDEG , the electric field and the PR $$R_{p}$$Rp increase , but will increase while the ZP $$r_{0}$$r0 of the PHP , the ground-state energy ( GSE ) and the temperature parameter $$\gamma$$γ become larger , respectively . That means that by changing the electric field , the temperature , the PR , the CP of the TDEG and the ZP of the PHP , one can adjust the GSL of polaron , which may offer new insight into studying many related applications in quantum computation ( QC ) and control of electron transition .

__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , The hard red spring wheat cultivars Grandin and CDC Teal were genetically examined to determine the number and identity of the leaf rust resistance genes present in both wheats . The two cultivars were crossed with the leaf rust susceptible cultivar Thatcher , and the F1 plants were backcrossed to Thatcher . Fifty-four and 80 BC1F1 plants derived respectively from Grandin and CDC Teal were selfed to produce BC1F2 families . The BC1F2 families were tested as seedlings with isolates of Puccinia recondita f . sp . tritici that differed for virulence to specific leaf rust resistance genes . The BC1F2 families were also tested in the adult-plant stage in field rust nursery tests . Segregation of BC1F2 families in the seedling tests indicated that Grandin had resistance genes Lr2a , Lr3 , and Lr10 , and was heterogeneous for Lr16 . CDC Teal was shown to have the seedling leaf rust gene Lr1 . In field rust nursery tests , both Grandin and CDC Teal were shown to have adult-plant resistance genes Lr13 and Lr34 . Additional leaf rust resistance genes that condition effective field resistance should be incorporated into hard red spring wheat cultivars to diversify the leaf rust resistance in this wheat class .

__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , In this work , a bulk liquid membrane method has been applied for Ni enrichment and separation from natural waters . The carrier-mediated transport was accomplished by pyridine-2-acetaldehyde benzoylhydrazone dissolved in toluene as a complexing agent . The preconcentration was achieved through pH control of source and receiving solutions via a counterflow of protons . The main variables were optimized by using a modified simplex technique . High transport efficiencies ( 101 . 2 ± 1 . 8–99 . 7 ± 4 . 2% ) were provided by the carrier for nickel ions in a receiving phase of 0 . 31 mol L−1 nitric acid after 9–13 h depending on sample salinity . The precision of the method was 2 . 05% ( without a saline matrix ) and 4 . 04% ( with 40 g L−1 NaCl ) at the 95% confidence level and the detection limit of the blank was 0 . 015 μg L−1 Ni for detection by atomic absorption spectroscopy . The applicability of the method was tested on certified reference and real water samples with successful results , even for saline samples . The relative errors were −0 . 60% for certified reference materials and ranged from −0 . 39 to 2 . 90% and from 0 . 3 to 11 . 05% for real samples , obtained by comparison of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry measurements , respectively .

__label__sciMet_Physical_Chemistry , Pyridine and piperidine inhibited the hydrodesulfurization of 4 , 6-dimethyldibenzothiophene ( 4 , 6-DM-DBT ) over alumina-supported Pt , Pd , and Pt–Pd catalysts . The Pd catalyst was least sensitive and the Pt–Pd catalysts were most sensitive to the nitrogen-containing compounds . Pyridine was a stronger inhibitor than piperidine at low initial pressure , but the reverse was true at high initial pressure . Hydrogenation of the tetrahydro to the hexahydro and on to the perhydro sulfur-containing intermediate as well as the removal of sulfur from these intermediates was slowed down by piperidine and pyridine . The hydrogenation pathway in the hydrodesulfurization of 4 , 6-DM-DBT was inhibited much more than the direct desulfurization pathway . The hydrogenation of the desulfurized products 3 , 3′-dimethylcyclohexylbenzene and 3 , 3′-dimethylbiphenyl over the Pt–Pd catalysts was suppressed by piperidine and pyridine . Piperidine and pyridine substantially decrease the ability of noble metal particles to convert refractory molecules like 4 , 6-DM-DBT and diminish the advantage of bimetallic Pt–Pd over monometallic Pt or Pd catalysts . Influence of nitrogen-containing components on the hydrodesulfurization of 4 , 6-dimethyldibenzothiophene over Pt , Pd , and Pt–Pd on alumina catalysts

__label__sciMet_Chemical_Physics , The net retention volumes relative to zero adsorbate coverage of adsorbent at 273 . 2 K , i . e . V0S ( 273 ) , have been determined on two active carbons with well-developed micropore structures . Kováts retention indices have been calculated on the basis of these net retention volumes using two methods . The first involved the substitution of the net retention volumes in the Kováts equation . The second method , which is a new method , involved a description of the net retention volumes by the function log V0S ( 273 ) = f ( Tc ) , where Tc is the column temperature , followed by the calculation of the average values for the net retention volumes using the best-fit curve . Kováts retention indices were then calculated from the average values of the net retention volumes . A comparison of the results obtained indicates that the new method appears to yield better values . The Kováts retention indices obtained via both methods were also calculated using a quadratic equation .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , In the present study , water quality of 16 springs , located along National Highway-58 from Rishikesh to Badrinath in India , was assessed by determining various physicochemical and microbiological parameters in three different seasons , i . e . , pre-monsoon , monsoon , and post-monsoon . For majority of the springs , the pH was slightly alkaline with temperature ranging between 10 and 27 °C . All other parameters such as total hardness ( TH ) , total alkalinity ( TA ) , chloride , phosphate , nitrate , total dissolved solids ( TDS ) , electrical conductivity ( EC ) , dissolved oxygen ( DO ) , and biochemical oxygen demand ( BOD ) were found to lie within the acceptable limit prescribed by various standard national and international agencies . The principal component analysis reveals that water quality of springs mainly depends on mineral contents of water , as there is a loading of TH , TA , EC , TDS , and other mineral components during one or other season of a year . The positive correlation coefficients determined among mineral components of spring water further substantiate this fact . No loading of DO , BOD , nitrate , and phosphate indicates an absence of anthropogenic pollution in the studied area . No trace metals were detected in any of the springs . Most probable number ( MPN ) index for coliforms was found to be above the acceptable limit for all the springs in one or more seasons of a year , except the one in Pandukeshwar . Plate-based assay revealed the presence of pathogens like Salmonella , Shigella , Vibrio , and Pseudomonas in some spring water . The findings of the present work reveal that due to high MPN index and presence of other pathogenic bacteria , water from most of the springs cannot be considered completely safe for direct human consumption in its raw form .

__label__sciMet_Electrical_&_Electronic_Engineering , In this paper , a phase control scheme for Class-DE-E dc-dc converter is proposed and its performance is clarified . The proposed circuit is composed of phase-controlled Class-DE inverter and Class-E rectifier . The proposed circuit achieves the fixed frequency control without frequency harmonics lower than the switching frequency . Moreover , it is possible to achieve the continuous control in a wide range of the line and load variations . The output voltage decreases in proportion to the increase of the phase shift . The proposed converter keeps the advantages of Class-DE-E dc-dc converter , namely , a high power conversion efficiency under a high-frequency operation and low switch-voltage stress . Especially , high power conversion efficiency can be kept for narrow range control .

__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , Mesoscopic simulations using Langevin dipoles on a lattice for the solvent and calculated partial charges for the solute have been used to estimate free energies of adsorption from data on reversed-phase chromatography on nine protected peptides covering a wide range of structures . There is a single parameter , the effective solvent dipole moment , that is fit to data for one peptide and used to predict properties of the other eight peptides . Good agreement of adsorption chemical potentials , including order of chromatographic retention times , is found for calculations that are Boltzmann-averaged over a set of orientations . In addition , the results suggest that there are preferential orientations for each peptide at the model hydrophobic chromatographic surface . Estimation methods for adsorption based on molecular descriptors and hydrophobicity scales are shown to be unreliable for these systems . With refinements and extensions , this simulation method should be applicable to solvents containing salt , such as in hydrophobic interaction chromatography , and to larger solutes including proteins .

__label__sciMet_Applied_Physics , In recent decades , non-classical continuum theories have been commonly utilized to model material discontinuities in micro-/nanoscales . In the present study , modified strain gradient theory ( MSGT ) together with the fully clamped cylindrical thin-shell model has been adopted to investigate the size-dependent nonlinear pull-in instability of thin cylindrical nano-/microshell . The modified strain gradient theory in cylindrical coordinates and virtual work principle has been applied to derive the constitutive size-dependent equations of motion . In this study , the linear strains have been utilized to establish a system of three-coupled partial differential equations . Further , effect of van der Waals force has been included in the nonlinear governing equations of the systems , and extended Kantorovich method has been used to solve the nonlinear differential equations that in turn lead to achieving the pull-in parameters of the microshell . From theoretical point of view , effect of van der Waals attraction , the size dependency , and the importance of coupling between them on the instability performance have been discussed and the pull-in parameters , i . e . , critical mid-deflection and instability voltage have been determined . It was found that comparable pull-in parameter of MSGT to those obtained by the classic theory , and modified couple stress theory depends only on the length scale of the microshell .

__label__sciMet_Evolutionary_Biology , Manganese ion ( Mn ( 2+ ) ) can substitute magnesium ion ( Mg ( 2+ ) ) in active sites of numerous enzymes . Binding sites for these two ions have been studied in two sets of protein 3D structures from the Protein Data Bank with the homology level lower than 25% . The structural motif beta strand - binder - random coil is predominant in both Mn ( 2+ ) and Mg ( 2+ ) coordination spheres , especially in functionally relevant ones . That predominant motif works as an active binder of those divalent cations which can then attract additional ligands , such as different phosphate-containing compounds . In contrast , such Mg ( 2+ ) and Mn ( 2+ ) binding motif as GK ( T/S ) T being the N-terminal part of alpha helices works as an active binder of phosphates which can then attract divalent cations . There are few differences between Mg ( 2+ ) and Mn ( 2+ ) coordination spheres responsible of the cation specificity . His residues are underrepresented in certain positions around Asp and Glu residues involved in Mg ( 2+ ) coordination , while they are overrepresented in certain positions around Asp and Glu residues coordinating Mn ( 2+ ) . The random coil region in the beta strand - random coil - alpha helix motif for Mg ( 2+ ) binding is usually shorter than that in the same motif for Mn ( 2+ ) coordination . This feature is associated with the lower number of binding amino acids ( and lower levels of usage of such major binders as Asp and Glu ) for Mg ( 2+ ) ( which is a hard Lewis acid ) in comparison with those for Mn ( 2+ ) ( an intermediate Lewis acid ) . Magnesium and manganese binding sites on proteins have the same predominant motif of secondary structure .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Engineering , The treatment of high ammonium-nitrogen concentration landfill leachate has become an increasing problem because of the requirements to reduce nutrient emissions . A laboratory-scale sequential batch reactor ( SBR ) was operated and tested in order to optimize the operational strategies of a cost-saving method to enhance the removal of ammonium-nitrogen from a real landfill leachate . Two sequence schemes were tested , one with long non-aerated/aerated sequences and another with short sequences . The air supply levels with low to intermediate dissolved oxygen ( DO ) and external carbon addition were altered . With both schemes a high ammonium reduction ( > 99% ) and a reasonable total nitrogen ( TN ) reduction ( around 60% ) could be achieved with strong carbon limitation ( BOD7/N = 1 . 1 ) . Chemical oxygen demand ( COD ) removal was lower with longer sequences . Denitrification via nitrite seemed to be an important part of TN removal , controlled with the low DO . With increasing nitrite accumulation COD/N removed decreased in both schemes indicating clearly a more efficient use of COD . The scheme with short sequences indicated advantages to save the air supply preventing nitrite oxidation under low air supply conditions and better TN and COD removal efficiencies . The results show that an applicable operational strategy can be found resulting in a reasonable pre-treatment option in landfills , requiring less carbon and aeration energy . Strategies to enhance the biological nitrogen removal of high-strength ammonium and low C/N landfill leachate with the SBR process .

__label__sciMet_Biomedical_Engineering , We aimed to investigate the fatigue strength of Co-Cr-Mo clasps for removable partial dentures prepared by selective laser melting ( SLM ) . The Co-Cr-Mo alloy specimens for tensile tests ( dumbbell specimens ) and fatigue tests ( clasp specimens ) were prepared by SLM with varying angles between the building and longitudinal directions ( i . e . , 0° ( TL0 , FL0 ) , 45° ( TL45 , FL45 ) , and 90° ( TL90 , FL90 ) ) . The clasp specimens were subjected to cyclic deformations of 0 . 25mm and 0 . 50mm for 10 ( 6 ) cycles . The SLM specimens showed no obvious mechanical anisotropy in tensile tests and exhibited significantly higher yield strength and ultimate tensile strength than the cast specimens under all conditions . In contrast , a high degree of anisotropy in fatigue performance associated with the build orientation was found . For specimens under the 0 . 50mm deflection , FL90 exhibited significantly longer fatigue life ( 205 , 418 cycles ) than the cast specimens ( 112 , 770 cycles ) . In contrast , the fatigue lives of FL0 ( 28 , 484 cycles ) and FL45 ( 43 , 465 cycles ) were significantly shorter . The surface roughnesses of FL0 and FL45 were considerably higher than those of the cast specimens , whereas there were no significant differences between FL90 and the cast specimens . Electron backscatter diffraction ( EBSD ) analysis indicated the grains of FL0 showed preferential close to <001> orientation of the γ phase along the normal direction to the fracture surface . In contrast , the FL45 and FL90 grains showed no significant preferential orientation . Fatigue strength may therefore be affected by a number of factors , including surface roughness and crystal orientation . The SLM process is a promising candidate for preparing tough removable partial denture frameworks , as long as the appropriate build direction is adopted .

__label__sciMet_Meteorology_&_Atmospheric_Sciences , The possible associations between climate parameters and drivers’ fatigue have not been subject to specific studies thus far . We have undertaken a study to investigate whether the particular climate parameters are related to fatigue perception by motor vehicle drivers . The study was performed from July to October . Each driver was surveyed four times before and after workshift on a monotonous route outside the city center ( MR ) , and on a heavy traffic route in the city center ( HTR ) . The study was conducted among 45 city bus drivers aged 31–58 years ( 43 . 7 ± 7 . 9 ) , seniority as driver 3–34 years ( 14 . 7 ± 8 . 6 ) . Data on climate conditions ( ambient temperature , air pressure , humidity , wind speed , precipitations ) on particular study days was obtained from the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management , National Research Institute Warsaw , Poland . Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Assessment Questionnaire , developed at Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine ( Lodz , Poland ) . The total level of fatigue was significantly ( p = 0 . 045 ) higher after driving on HTR than on MR . The number of symptoms was also significantly higher ( p < 0 . 05 ) among drivers working on HTR . After MR , significant correlations were found between wind speed and heavy eyelid feeling , being prone to forgetting , eye strain , frequent blinking , and between ambient temperature and feeling thirsty . After HTR feeling thirsty , tiredness and difficulty in making decisions correlated with ambient temperature and feeling thirsty with wind speed . Climate conditions can modify the drivers fatigue therefore , we should be aware of their impact on well-being . Climate conditions and work-related fatigue among professional drivers

__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , One of the major challenges currently faced is to develop systematic ways of addressing chemical mixtures in environmental assessment . With this purpose , a simple , rapid , and sensitive method for the detection and quantification of a mixture of relevant contaminants in molluscs has been developed . The method is based on QuEChERS ( Quick , Easy , Cheap , Effective , Rugged and Safe ) and Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry ( UHPLC-HRMS ) . It includes a mixture of 23 compounds formed by pesticides , endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals ( metolachlor , simazine , desethylatrazine , atrazine , thiabendazole , diazinon , malathion , bentazone , MCPA , propanil , acetamiprid , imidacloprid , caffeine , bisphenol A , triclosan , triclocarban , methylparaben , ethylparaben , propylparaben , 1H-benzotriazole , sulfamethoxazole , venlafaxine and carbamazepine ) . The method was developed and validated in 4 different types of shellfish of high commercial interest such as mussel ( Mytilus galloprovincialis ) , oyster ( Crassostrea gigas ) , cockle ( Cerastoderma edule ) and razor shell ( Solen marginatus ) . The mean percentage of recoveries obtained for all the compounds in each mollusc type ( intra-specie ) ranged from 96% to 107% showing the good performance of the method developed . The relative standard deviation was under 10% for the intra-day and 17% inter-day analyses . Method detection limits and method quantification limits were below 10 ng/g dry weight for all the species and compounds targeted .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , Oxidative degradation of aqueous organic pollutants , using 4-chlorophenol ( 4-CP ) as a main model substrate , was achieved with the concurrent H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) -mediated transformation of Cr ( III ) to Cr ( VI ) . The Fenton-like oxidation of 4-CP is initiated by the reaction between the aquo-complex of Cr ( III ) and H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) , which generates HO ( • ) along with the stepwise oxidation of Cr ( III ) to Cr ( VI ) . The Cr ( III ) /H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) system is inactive in acidic condition , but exhibits maximum oxidative capacity at neutral and near-alkaline pH . Since we previously reported that Cr ( VI ) can also activate H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) to efficiently generate HO ( • ) , the dual role of H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) as an oxidant of Cr ( III ) and a reductant of Cr ( VI ) can be utilized to establish a redox cycle of Cr ( III ) -Cr ( VI ) -Cr ( III ) . As a result , HO ( • ) can be generated using both Cr ( III ) /H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) and Cr ( VI ) /H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) reactions , either concurrently or sequentially . The formation of HO ( • ) was confirmed by monitoring the production of p-hydroxybenzoic acid from [benzoic acid + HO ( • ) ] as a probe reaction and by quenching the degradation of 4-CP in the presence of methanol as a HO ( • ) scavenger . The oxidation rate of 4-CP in the Cr ( III ) /H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) solution was highly influenced by pH , which is ascribed to the hydrolysis of Cr ( III ) ( H ( 2 ) O ) ( n ) into Cr ( III ) ( H ( 2 ) O ) ( n-m ) ( OH ) ( m ) and the subsequent condensation to oligomers . The present study proposes that the Cr ( III ) /H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) combined with Cr ( VI ) /H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) process is a viable advanced oxidation process that operates over a wide pH range using the reusable redox cycle of Cr ( III ) and Cr ( VI ) . Advanced oxidation process based on the Cr ( III ) /Cr ( VI ) redox cycle .

__label__sciMet_General_Chemistry , Mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSNs ) containing a hexagonal array of one-dimensional channels with diameters of 2 . 4 nm were synthesized using a surfactant-templated , base-catalyzed condensation reaction . After extraction of the template , the highly porous 75 nm nanospheres were coated with a Gd−Si−DTTA complex to give MSN−Gd particles that exhibit very high MR relaxivities . The MSN−Gd nanoparticles were characterized using SEM , TEM , TGA , BET , PXRD , and DCP , and the relaxivities were determined on both a 3 . 0 T and a 9 . 4 T MR scanner . The MSN−Gd particles exhibit very high MR relaxivity on a per Gd basis and even more impressive MR relaxivity on a per nanoparticle basis , owing to the ready access of water molecules through the nanochannels of the MSN−Gd particles and a high payload of Gd centers . The in vivo efficacy of these particles as MR contrast agents was further demonstrated with monocyte cells and mouse models .

__label__sciMet_General_Physics , A new design concept for the Josephson-junction random access memory ( RAM ) has been developed . In contrast to previous RAMs based on single flux quantization ( SFQ ) , in our system READ and WRITE operations employ ballistic transfer of SFQ pulses along bit lines ( either Josephson transmission lines , or passive superconducting microstrip lines , or their combination ) . The basic memory cells are the single-junction SQUIDs , connected serially by the bit lines and inductively coupled to word lines . READ and WRITE operations are performed by sending SFQ pulses in appropriate directions along bit lines , and DC currents of appropriate polarity into word lines . This approach allows design of very dense memories with n/spl les/2 Josephson junctions per bit , memory cell area smaller than 80 /spl lambda//sup 2/ ( where /spl lambda/ is the minimum feature size ) , and the critical parameter margin well above /spl plusmn/20% .

__label__sciMet_Marine_Biology_&_Hydrobiology , Benthic communities in several fjords and sheltered bays of the north coast of South Georgia Island were examined using SCUBA and shore sampling in November 2004 . It is one of the most northerly islands within the Polar Front and its well studied , terrestrial biota is described as sub Antarctic . The intertidal and subtidal zones and their fauna are , by comparison , little known . We describe the composition of the substratum and benthic communities of sites in several northern bays , including an exceptional community in the extremely sheltered Moraine Fjord with a 2 m sill at its entrance . In this , like those in some other fjordic systems , some taxa occur shallower than elsewhere , and in this instance , get large and are probably old . Elsewhere , we found the coastal fauna was fairly similar to Antarctic shallow communities in the southern Scotia Arc and Peninsula region . Of the taxa we found , we identified 53 to genus and 41 to species . Most of these were typical Antarctic shallow benthic taxa . Certain flatworms , nemerteans , bivalve and gastropod molluscs , amphipod and isopod crustaceans , asteroid echinoderms and stalked ascidians were very abundant , but some normally common Antarctic higher taxa and species were notably absent or rare .

__label__sciMet_Electrical_&_Electronic_Engineering , In many of today ' s system-on-chip ( SoC ) designs , the cores are partitioned into multiple voltage and frequency islands ( VFIs ) , and the global interconnect is implemented using a packet-switched network on chip ( NoC ) . In such VFI-based designs , the benefits of 3-D integration in reducing the NoC power or delay are unclear , as a significant fraction of power is spent in link-level synchronization , and stacked designs may impose many synchronization boundaries . In this brief , we show the quantitative benefits of the 3-D technology on NoC power and delay values for such application-specific designs . We show a design flow for building application-specific NoCs for both 2-D and 3-D SoCs with multiple VFIs . We present a detailed case study of NoCs designed using the flow for a mobile platform . Our results show that power savings strongly depend on the number of VFIs used ( up to 32% reduction ) . This motivates the need for an early architectural space exploration , as allowed by our flow . Our experiments also show that the reduction in delay is only marginal when moving from 2-D to 3-D systems ( up to 11% ) , if both are designed efficiently .

__label__sciMet_Networking_&_Telecommunications , A new beamforming scheme is proposed for multi-input multi-output ( MIMO ) non-regenerative relays in an overloaded synchronous direct sequence code division multiple access ( DS-CDMA ) network in which the number of users is larger than the processing gain . In this scheme , several transmitters multicast their data to their groups of receivers through MIMO relays and DS-CDMA technique is utilised to decrease the level of multiple access interference ( MAI ) at the relays and the receivers . At the relays , the data of transmitters are despread , beamformed and re-spread . The aim of the beamformer is to minimise the total relays transmission power subject to the signal to interference and noise ratio ( SINR ) constraints at the receivers . This optimisation problem is an indefinite quadratic ( non-convex ) programming . Semi-definite programming ( SDP ) and second-order cone programming ( SOCP ) are two existing methods to solve the problem . However , they , respectively , suffer from high computational complexity and performance degradation when the number of antennas or users increase . To effectively mitigate these deficiencies , we propose a novel DC ( difference of two convex functions ) programming method . Our simulation results demonstrate the computational advantage of the proposed DC programming over SDP , while a better performance over SOCP is achieved . Moreover , the superiority of the proposed MIMO-CDMA scheme over other multiplexing schemes is shown by several scenarios . Cooperative MIMO relay beamforming in overloaded DS/CDMA multicast networks

However , they are only likely to be used if they meet patients ' perceived needs . We have developed an Internet intervention in two stages to meet the needs of patients with coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . First , user-generated criteria were applied to an existing US-based intervention called ‘CHESS Living with Heart Disease’ which provides information , emotional and social support , self-assessment and monitoring tools , and behavioural change support . This identifed the development work required . Then we conducted a user evaluation with a panel of five patients with CHD . Overall , users generally made positive comments about the information content . However they were critical of presentation , ease of navigation through the content , understanding what was offered in the different services and finding the information they were after .

A search for an additional service facility for the service of a group of units is started when the queue length increases to K ( 0 < K < L ) , where L is the maximum waiting space . The search is dropped when the queue length reduces to some tolerable fixed size L - N . The availability time of an additional service facility is a random variable .

__label__sciMet_Software_Engineering , Hand-held object recognition is an important research topic in image understanding and plays an essential role in human-machine interaction . With the easily available RGB-D devices , the depth information greatly promotes the performance of object segmentation and provides additional channel information . While how to extract a representative and discriminating feature from object region and efficiently take advantage of the depth information plays an important role in improving hand-held object recognition accuracy and eventual human-machine interaction experience . In this paper , we focus on a special but important area called RGB-D hand-held object recognition and propose a hierarchical feature learning framework for this task . First , our framework learns modality-specific features from RGB and depth images using CNN architectures with different network depth and learning strategies . Secondly a high-level feature learning network is implemented for a comprehensive feature representation . Different with previous works on feature learning and representation , the hierarchical learning method can sufficiently dig out the characteristics of different modal information and efficiently fuse them in a unified framework . The experimental results on HOD dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method . Modality-specific and hierarchical feature learning for RGB-D hand-held object recognition

__label__sciMet_Evolutionary_Biology , Microbes are abundant in nature and often highly adapted to local conditions . While great progress has been made in understanding the ecological factors driving their distribution in complex environments , the underpinning molecular-evolutionary mechanisms are rarely dissected . Therefore , we scrutinized the coupling of environmental and molecular adaptation in Thaumarchaeota , an abundant archaeal phylum with a key role in ammonia oxidation . These microbes are adapted to a diverse spectrum of environmental conditions , with pH being a key factor shaping their contemporary distribution and evolutionary diversification . We integrated high-throughput sequencing data spanning a broad representation of ammonia-oxidizing terrestrial lineages with codon modelling analyses , testing the hypothesis that ammonia monooxygenase subunit A ( AmoA ) - a highly conserved membrane protein crucial for ammonia oxidation and classical marker in microbial ecology - underwent adaptation during specialization to extreme pH environments . While purifying selection has been an important factor limiting AmoA evolution , we identified episodic shifts in selective pressure at the base of two phylogenetically distant lineages that independently adapted to acidic conditions and subsequently gained lasting ecological success . This involved nonconvergent selective mechanisms ( positive selection vs . selection acting on variants fixed during an episode of relaxed selection ) leading to unique sets of amino acid substitutions that remained fixed across the radiation of both acidophilic lineages , highlighting persistent adaptive value in acidic environments . Our data demonstrates distinct trajectories of AmoA evolution despite convergent phenotypic adaptation , suggesting that microbial environmental specialization can be associated with diverse signals of molecular adaptation , even for marker genes employed routinely by microbial ecologists .

Despite a saturating N supply , the youngest mature leaves ( seventh position on the stem ) contained little NO3- reserve . Droughted plants ( deprived of nutrient solution ) showed changes in foliar enzyme activities , mRNA accumulation , photosynthesis , and carbohydrate and amino acid contents . Total leaf water potential and CO2 assimilation rates , measured 3 h into the photoperiod , decreased 3 d after the onset of drought . Starch , glucose , fructose , and amino acids , but not sucrose ( Suc ) , accumulated in the leaves of droughted plants . Maximal extractable phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activities increased slightly during water deficit , whereas the sensitivity of this enzyme to the inhibitor malate decreased . Maximal extractable Suc phosphate synthase activities decreased as a result of water stress , and there was an increase in the sensitivity to the inhibitor orthophosphate . A correlation between maximal extractable foliar nitrate reductase ( NR ) activity and the rate of CO2 assimilation was observed . The NR activation state and maximal extractable NR activity declined rapidly in response to drought . Photosynthesis and NR activity recovered rapidly when nutrient solution was restored at this point . The decrease in maximal extractable NR activity was accompanied by a decrease in NR transcripts , whereas Suc phosphate synthase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase mRNAs were much less affected .

__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , The role of heterotrimeric G proteins in gibberellin ( GA ) induction of a-amylase gene expression was examined in wild oat aleurone protoplasts . Mas7 , a cationic amphiphilic tetradecapeptide that stimulates GDP/GTP exchange by heterotrimeric G proteins , specifically induced alpha-amylase gene expression and enzyme secretion in a very similar manner to GA1 . In addition , Mas7 stimulated expression of an alpha-Amy2/54 GUS promoter and reporter construct in transformed protoplasts . Both Mas7 and GA1 induction of alpha-amylase mRNA were insensitive to pertussis toxin . Hydrolysis-resistant nucleotides were introduced into aleurone protoplasts during transfection with reporter gene constructs . GDP-beta-S , which inhibits GDP/GTP exchange by heterotrimeric G proteins , completely prevented GA1 induction of alpha-Amy2/54 GUS expression , whereas GTP-gamma-S , which activates heterotrimeric G proteins , stimulated expression very slightly . Novel cDNA sequences from Galpha and Gbeta subunits were cloned from wild oat aleurone cells . By using RNA gel blot analysis , we found that the transcripts were expressed at a low level . Heterotrimeric G proteins have been implicated in several events during plant growth and development , and these data suggest that they may be involved in GA regulation of alpha-amylase gene expression in aleurone .

__label__sciMet_Geochemistry_&_Geophysics , Marine geophysical data collected by government and academic vessels are archived at the US National Geophysical Data Center in Boulder , Colorado . Data exchanges between NGDC and source institutions use an ASCII , punch-card format known as the MGD77 format , reflecting a style of file design common in the 1970s . We have developed a set of new software tools that can convert between this exchange format and a new COARDS-compliant , netCDF-based , architecture-independent file format that we call the MGD77+ format . The new mgd77 tools allow the data to be manipulated in a variety of ways useful for marine research . These tools are written in POSIX-compliant C , are distributed as a supplement to the Generic Mapping Tools , and can be installed on any computer platform . Because the new format is COARDS and CF-1 . 0 compliant , the files can be read by any general-purpose program capable of decoding these standards a welcome side effect . One such program is the Java application ncBrowse developed by NOAA . Furthermore , the more compact netCDF files have file sizes that are , on average , only 30% of the original sizes . Because procedural changes at NGDC and source institutions necessarily occur infrequently , it is expected that the MGD77 format will remain the official exchange format for underway geophysical data for some time , whereas the new MGD77+ format offers users much needed flexibility in how they use the data .

__label__sciMet_Computation_Theory_&_Mathematics , This paper addresses the problem of non-Bayesian learning over multi-agent networks , where agents repeatedly collect partially informative observations about an unknown state of the world , and try to collaboratively learn the true state out of m alternatives . We focus on the impact of adversarial agents on the performance of consensus-based non-Bayesian learning , where non-faulty agents combine local learning updates with consensus primitives . In particular , we consider the scenario where an unknown subset of agents suffer Byzantine faults—agents suffering Byzantine faults behave arbitrarily . We propose two learning rules . In our learning rules , each non-faulty agent keeps a local variable which is a stochastic vector over the m possible states . Entries of this stochastic vector can be viewed as the scores assigned to the corresponding states by that agent . We say a non-faulty agent learns the underlying truth if it assigns one to the true state and zeros to the wrong states asymptotically . In our first update rule , each agent updates its local score vector as ( up to normalization ) the product of ( 1 ) the likelihood of the cumulative private signals and ( 2 ) the weighted geometric average of the score vectors of its incoming neighbors and itself . Under reasonable assumptions on the underlying network structure and the global identifiability of the network , we show that all the non-faulty agents asymptotically learn the true state almost surely . We propose a modified variant of our first learning rule whose complexity per iteration per agent is $$O ( m^2 n \log n ) $$O ( m2nlogn ) , where n is the number of agents in the network . In addition , we show that this modified learning rule works under a less restrictive network identifiability condition . Defending non-Bayesian learning against adversarial attacks

The uniqueness of the solution of the linear complementarity problem is also discussed . Characterizations for solidness of dual cones with applications
__label__sciMet_Entomology , Metabolic cold adaptation ( MCA ) is a controversial hypothesis suggesting that cold adapted species display an elevated metabolic rate ( MR ) compared to their warm climate relatives . Here we test for the presence of MCA in 65 species of drosophilid flies reared under common garden conditions . MR was measured at both 10 and 20°C for both sexes and data were analyzed in relation to the natural thermal environment of these species . We found considerable interspecific variation in MR ranging from 1 . 34 to 8 . 99µWmg-1 at 10°C . As predicted by Bergmann ' s rule body mass of fly species correlated negatively with annual mean temperature ( AMT ) , such that larger species were found in colder environments . Because larger flies have a higher total MR we found MR to vary with AMT , however , after inclusion of mass as a co-variate we found no significant effect of AMT . Furthermore , we did not find that thermal sensitivity of MR ( Q10 ) varied with AMT . Based on this broad collection of species we therefore conclude that there is no adaptive pattern of metabolic cold adaptation within drosophilid species ranging from sub-arctic to tropical environments . Metabolic cold adaptation contributes little to the interspecific variation in metabolic rates of 65 species of Drosophilidae .

__label__sciMet_Artificial_Intelligence_&_Image_Processing , The problems of dense stereo reconstruction and object class segmentation can both be formulated as Random Field labeling problems , in which every pixel in the image is assigned a label corresponding to either its disparity , or an object class such as road or building . While these two problems are mutually informative , no attempt has been made to jointly optimize their labelings . In this work we provide a flexible framework configured via cross-validation that unifies the two problems and demonstrate that , by resolving ambiguities , which would be present in real world data if the two problems were considered separately , joint optimization of the two problems substantially improves performance . To evaluate our method , we augment the Leuven data set ( http //cms . brookes . ac . uk/research/visiongroup/files/Leuven . zip ) , which is a stereo video shot from a car driving around the streets of Leuven , with 70 hand labeled object class and disparity maps . We hope that the release of these annotations will stimulate further work in the challenging domain of street-view analysis .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Engineering , The results presented in this study illustrate the multiple roles of seawater salinity toward the sonochemical degradation , at variable frequencies ( 300-1700kHz ) , of several hazardous substances , i . e . propylparaben ( PPR ) endocrine disruptor and several synthetic dyes naphthol blue black ( NBB ) , malachite green ( MG ) , basic red 29 ( BR29 ) , acid orange 7 ( AO7 ) , Rhodamine B ( RhB ) and basic fuchsin ( BF ) . Sonochemical treatment degraded all pollutants in seawater at faster rates than in deionized water . The seawater-salts through increasing ionic strength of the solution act as potential pusher of hydrophilic pollutants toward the reactive interfacial area of cavitation bubbles . Additionally , the salts reduce the bubble coalescence , which yields higher number of active bubbles in the irradiating media . Analyzing the degradation rate of PPR and NBB with two heterogeneous models based on Langmuir kinetics mechanism indicated that the bubble interfacial area was the preferred reaction zone for the ultrasonic degradation of PPR and NBB in seawater . Impact of seawater salinity on the sonochemical removal of emerging organic pollutants .

__label__sciMet_Nuclear_&_Particles_Physics , The strong phases and CP violation in the rare B̄0→K+K- , K*±K∓ , K*+K*- decays are investigated . As these decays proceed only via annihilation type diagrams in the standard model ( SM ) , a dynamical gluon mass is introduced to avoid the infrared divergence in the soft endpoint regions . The Cutkosky rule is adopted to deal with a physical-region singularity of the on-mass-shell quark propagators , which leads to a big imaginary part and hence a large strong phase . As a consequence , large CP asymmetries are predicted in those decay modes due to a big interference between the annihilation amplitudes from penguin and tree operators , which may be tested in future more precise experiments .

__label__sciMet_Mechanical_Engineering_&_Transports , The contour method is applied in an innovative manner to measure the distribution of hoop residual stress in a large martensitic-ferritic steel pipe containing a multi-pass girth weld . First , a novel one-step wire electro-discharge machining cut is conducted to divide the pipe lengthways into two halves . The deformation of the cut halves is then measured and analysed in a way that simultaneously gives maps of hoop stress across the wall thickness on both sides of the pipe and automatically accounts for through-thickness hoop bending effects and how they may vary along the pipe . Finally the contour method results are combined with X-ray diffraction residual stress measurements using the principle of superposition to determine the distribution of the axial and radial residual stresses in the pipe . It is thereby demonstrated how the distribution of three direct components of the residual stress tensor in a welded pipe can be readily determined using a “hybrid” contour measurement approach .

__label__sciMet_Chemical_Engineering , A novel technique utilizing the gelation reaction of natural polymers has been proposed for the separation of solid from liquid in difficult-to-filter colloidal suspensions . This technique is especially effective in the treatment of colloidal muddy water of high solid concentration , which is often produced as a byproduct of certain construction processes . Colloidal suspensions are mixed with a sodium alginate solution , and this mixture is added to a calcium chloride solution , resulting in the entrapping of colloidal particles by the calcium alginate gel . Gel suspensions are then drained gravitationally , followed by mechanical expression of gel particles . Fundamental aspects of this process are investigated by using sodium bentonite as an experimental material . The alginate-bentonite mixture is added dropwise to the calcium solution . Decreasing the droplet size of the mixture expedites gelation since the diffusion of calcium ions into droplets determines the rate of gelation reactions . Reducing the alginate content expedites expression of the gel since alginate content is inversely proportional to the rate of expression .

__label__sciMet_Marine_Biology_&_Hydrobiology , Organisms and chemicals preserved in sediment cores from the Chesapeake estuary in mid-Atlantic USA are consistent with a precolonial landscape covered with a diversity of forests and marshes , large and small . During the past 300 years , many of the wetlands have been drained , and the landscape was converted to agricultural fields and urban and suburban development . During this time , sources of nitrogen have diversified , and loadings have increased . Since precolonial time , the mesohaline estuary has become increasingly eutrophic and anoxic . Estuaries and coastal regions throughout the world have experienced similar conditions in their recent history . These changes are recorded in Chesapeake sediment cores by increases in ragweed pollen , dry taxa , sedimentation rates , nitrogen influxes , and a major change in estuarine autotrophs from benthic to planktonic . In many areas , attempts to reverse estuarine eutrophication and anoxia have centered on restoring streams and riparian areas and reducing fertilizer use on agricultural lands . However , data from soils and historical reports and the paleoecological record suggest that to reduce the effects of modern nitrogen inputs , it may be necessary to locate and enhance denitrifying areas throughout the watershed .

A depth-independent matrix is developed to help design an observer for estimating the unknown positions of target points on the spacecraft in the inertial frame . The target points are used to estimate depth information for visual servo control . An adaptive controller is used to force the feature points on the target to converge onto the desired positions on the image plane as well as estimate the uncertain dynamic parameters . The Lyapunov approach is used to show asymptotic stability of the system and convergence of image errors . Finally , simulation results are presented to validate the performance of the proposed control algorithm . Eye-in-Hand Tracking Control of a Free-Floating Space Manipulator
__label__sciMet_Applied_Physics , The structural and electrical properties of thin granular metal films obtained by laser electrodispersion were studied . Such structures , which consist of amorphous copper grains 5 nm in size , were established to be extremely stable against oxidation . For instance , when oxidized in air , copper grains were covered by Cu2O oxide shells about 1 nm thick after a period of a few days , after which further growth of the oxide in thickness stopped . The oxidized close-packed structures conduct current through intergrain tunneling electron transitions , whereas in partially oxidized structures the conduction involves tunneling electron hopping between conducting ensembles made up of several nanoparticles . It was shown that the size of the nanoparticles and of the conducting ensembles can be found by analyzing the temperature dependence of the conductivity and , independently , from the I–V characteristics of the films .

Here we generalize this class of models by introducing a parameter α inversely proportional to the curvature of the inflaton Kähler manifold . In the small curvature ( large α ) limit , the observational predictions of this class of models coincide with the predictions of generic chaotic inflation models . However , for sufficiently large curvature ( small α ) , the predictions converge to the universal attractor regime with $ {n_s}=1-\frac{2}{N} $ and $ r=\alpha \frac{12 }{{{N^2}}} $ , which corresponds to the part of the ns − r plane favored by the Planck data .

The anatomical , histochemical and phenological synchronisation strategies between Calophya rubra ( Blanchard ) ( Hemiptera Psylloidea ) and its host , the evergreen plant Schinus polygama ( Cav . ) ( Cabrera ) ( Anacardiaceae ) , in the Mediterranean climate of southern Chile was evaluated and compared to that of the congeneric C . cf . duvauae ( Scott ) from Brazil and closely related host plant S .  engleri in a subtropical climate . Anatomical , histometric , histochemical and vegetative phenology studies of the stem and galls were conducted from June 2015 to December 2016 .

The aim of this study was to determine its genetic structure in Japan , China , and Korea by means of nucleotide sequence analysis of a 507-bp portion of themitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene . Of 180 individuals collected from three localities in Japan and one locality each from China and Korea , a total of 66 haplotypes were found on the basis of 56 variable nucleotides . Although Japan and Korea populations shared six common haplotypes , there was no common haplotype between Japan/Korea and China . The pairwise FST and genetic distance values were comprehensively high , with significant differences between Japan/Korea and China , indicating that the divergence had reached subspecies level . In conclusion , haphazard transplantation and import of seedlings and/or adults of S . broughtonii and its related species should be absolutely avoided as S . broughtonii had previously shown distinct genetic differences between Japan/Korea and China .

__label__sciMet_Polymers , Ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ( USPIOs ) with diameters <5 nm hold great promise as T1-positive contrast agents for in vivo magnetic resonance imaging . However , control of the surface chemistry of USPIOs to ensure individual colloidal USPIOs with a ligand monolayer and to impart biocompatibility and enhanced colloidal stability is essential for successful clinical applications . Herein , an effective and versatile strategy enabling the development of aqueous colloidal USPIOs stabilized with well-defined multidentate block copolymers ( MDBCs ) is reported . The multifunctional MDBCs are designed to consist of an anchoring block possessing pendant carboxylates as multidentate anchoring groups strongly bound to USPIO surfaces and a hydrophilic block having pendant hydrophilic oligo ( ethylene oxide ) chains to confer water dispersibility and biocompatibility . The surface of USPIOs is saturated with multiple anchoring groups of MDBCs , thus exhibiting excellent long-term colloidal stability as well as enhanced colloidal stability at biologically relevant electrolyte , pH , and temperature conditions . Furthermore , relaxometric properties as well as in vitro and in vivo MR imaging results demonstrate that the MDBC-stabilized USPIO colloids hold great potential as an effective T1 contrast agent .

In the first procedure partial molar volume is calculated based on mathematical fitting of molar volume , while in the second procedure partial molar volume is calculated based on mathematical fitting of excess molar volume . It was shown that both procedures are in principle consistent . However , some inconsistencies on values of partial molar volume can occur when local extremes are observed on concentration dependence of molar volume . In such situation , proper selection of mathematical functions is essential which requires relatively high density of experimental data . Moreover , when data on only restricted concentration range are available , only procedure of molar volume fitting is applicable for calculation of partial molar volume .

__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , SummaryThe effects of the elimination of the nuclear control on the ultrastructure of the green algaMicrasterias torreyi . Bail , have been studied by using centrifugation for denucleation and lethal dose of UV-light . Centrifugated anucleate cells were fixed 7 and 26 hours after the treatment and the UV-treated cells 4 and 8 hours after the irradiation . Although both treatments eliminate the nuclear control and the treated cells resemble morphologically each other , yet there are differences in ultrastructure suggesting that they are also brought about by other factors than the presence of nucleus . Both the treatments cause accumulation of cell wall material in the tips of lobes . The cell wall shows unusual secondary thickening with electron dense spots embedded in the matrix . The denucleation retards the functional cycle of Golgi apparatus and the production of vesicles has stopped in the 26-hour-denucleated cells . It is possible that flat vesicle production is totally absent in denucleated cells . First the UV-treatment seems to activate the function of Golgi apparatus but later on the vesicle production almost stops . It seems to eliminate the production of large vesicles but not that of dark vesicles . Both the treatments cause deterioration of ER membranes and polysomes , and in consequence , probably inhibit protein synthesis . Unlike UV-irradiation , denucleation appears to destroy the microtubule system . Mitochondrial cristae have almost entirely vanished within 26 hours after denucleation .

Fluxes of main cations and anions were calculated by multiplying water fluxes through the different compartments with the appropriate ion concentrations . Both spruce stands are characterized by a sufficient water supply throughout the investigation period caused by high annual precipitation . Only in dry periods drastical restriction of plant available water may endanger those spruces growing on very stony podzols and cambisols . The calculation of deposition fluxes differentiates the damaged and the apparently healthy spruce stand . Input of SO2 and H+ as well as canopy buffering and K-leaching of the canopies are significantly higher in the damaged spruce stand than in the healthy one . Additionally , the exchangeable base cation content of the soil on the damaged site is nearly exhausted and therefore buffering capacity in the soil differs from those of the healthy site . There was a low increase of N03-leaching with seepage after the fertilization with high amounts of lime . Water , nutrient and pollutant budgets in damaged Norway spruce stands in NE-Bavaria ( F .

__label__sciMet_Electrical_&_Electronic_Engineering , This brief proposes an efficient radix-2 single-path delay commutator ( SDC ) pipelined architecture to implement the fast Walsh-Hadamard-Fourier transform ( FWFT ) algorithm . The proposed architecture includes ( log2 N - 1 ) SDC stages , which are implemented by merged half-butterfly . The merged half-butterfly is proposed to achieve 100% hardware utilization and minimum buffer usage by sharing common merged half-butterflies in the time-multiplexed approach . Compared with the conventional pipelined radix-2 FFT+Walsh-Hadamard Transform ( WHT ) designs , the proposed architecture reduces the number of buffers by 50% and of adders by 25% . The required number of complex multipliers is decreased to 0 . 5 log2 N - 0 . 5 , which is roughly the minimum number . Moreover , the proposed architecture can be applied to FFT/WHT/sequence-ordered complex Hadamard transform ( SCHT ) .

__label__sciMet_General_Physics , The authors describe a procedure for using thin layers of gold foil to make thermal contact between insulating substrates and Haynes alloy heater blocks . This method has several advantages over using silver paste compounds to improve the thermal contact . Samples are easily removed from the metal blocks after heating up to 850 degrees C , and no prebake process is required prior to sample loading into the deposition chamber since no organic binder is used . Because only a thin layer ( 1- mu m thick ) of gold foil is required , the method is extremely economical . Thermal contact resistance measurements performed using MgO substrates demonstrate that this technique promotes thermal contact between the substrate and heater block comparable to silver paste . These measurements are presented along with a design for a fixture capable of holding wafers up to 0 . 75 in diameter . <<ETX>> Non-silver paste method for making thermal contact to substrates for high T/sub c/ film growth
__label__sciMet_General_Chemistry , The heterogeneous nature of a protein surface plays an essential role in its biological activity and molecular recognition , and this role is mediated at least partly through the surrounding water molecules . We have performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of an aqueous solution of HP-36 to investigate the correlation between the dynamics of the hydration layer water molecules and the lifetimes of protein-water hydrogen bonds . The nonexponential hydrogen bond lifetime correlation functions have been analyzed by using the formalism of Luzar and Chandler , which allowed identification of the quasi-bound states in the surface and quantification of the dynamic equilibrium between quasi-bound and free water molecules in terms of time-dependent rate of interconversion . It is noticed that , irrespective of the structural heterogeneity of different segments of the protein , namely the three alpha-helices , the positively charged amino acid residues form longer-lived hydrogen bonds with water . The overall relaxation behavior of protein-water hydrogen bonds is found to differ significantly among the three helices of the protein . Study of water number density fluctuation reveals that the hydration layer of helix-3 is much less rigid , which can be correlated with faster structural relaxation of the hydrogen bonds between its residues and water . This also agrees excellently with faster translational and rotational motions of water near helix-3 , and hence the lower rigidity of its hydration layer . The lower rigidity of the helix-3 hydration layer also correlates well with the biological activity of the protein , as several of the active-site residues of HP-36 are located in helix-3 . Secondary structure sensitivity of hydrogen bond lifetime dynamics in the protein hydration layer .

These metaheuristics can find a nearly optimal solution faster than other traditional algorithms even for high-dimensional optimization problems . All these algorithms have a similar structure , the difference being made by the strategies used during the evolutionary process . A set of three nature-inspired algorithms , including Cuckoo Search algorithm ( CSA ) , Particle Swarm Optimization ( PSO ) , and Multi-Swarm Optimization ( MSO ) , are compared in terms of strategies used in the evolutionary process and also of the results obtained in case of particular optimization problems . METHODS The three algorithms were applied for biomedical image registration ( IR ) and compared in terms of performances . The expected geometric transform has seven parameters and is composed of rotation against a point in the image , scaling on both axis with different factors , and translation . The evaluation consisted of 25 runs of each IR procedure and revealed that ( 1 ) PSO offers the most precise solutions ( 2 ) CSA and MSO are more stable in the sense that their solutions are less scattered and ( 3 ) MSO and PSO have a higher convergence speed . The evaluation of PSO , MSO , and CSA was made for multimodal IR problems . It is possible that for other optimization problems and also for other settings of the optimization algorithms , the results can be different . Therefore , the nature-inspired algorithms demonstrated their efficacy for this class of optimization problems .

Adsorption and powder X-ray diffraction studies indicate that each coordinatively unsaturated metal atom in the structure coordinates to one NO molecule . All of the stored gas is available for delivery even after the material has been stored for several months . The combination of extremely high adsorption capacity ( approximately 7 mmol of NO/g of MOF ) and good storage stability is ideal for the preparation of NO storage solids . However , most important is that the entire reservoir of stored gas is recoverable on contact with a simple trigger ( moisture ) . The activity of the NO storage materials is proved in myography experiments showing that the NO-releasing MOFs cause relaxation of porcine arterial tissue .

__label__sciMet_Acoustics , In this paper , new nonlinear dynamic formulations for belt drives based on the three-dimensional absolute nodal coordinate formulation are developed . Two large deformation three-dimensional finite elements are used to develop two different belt-drive models that have different numbers of degrees of freedom and different modes of deformation . Both three-dimensional finite elements are based on a nonlinear elasticity theory that accounts for geometric nonlinearities due to large deformation and rotations . The first element is a thin-plate element that is based on the Kirchhoff plate assumptions and captures both membrane and bending stiffness effects . The other three-dimensional element used in this investigation is a cable element obtained from a more general three-dimensional beam element by eliminating degrees of freedom which are not significant in some cable and belt applications . Both finite elements used in this investigation allow for systematic inclusion or exclusion of the bending stiffness , thereby enabling systematic examination of the effect of bending on the nonlinear dynamics of belt drives . The finite-element formulations developed in this paper are implemented in a general purpose three-dimensional flexible multibody algorithm that allows for developing more detailed models of mechanical systems that include belt drives subject to general loading conditions , nonlinear algebraic constraints , and arbitrary large displacements . The use of the formulations developed in this investigation is demonstrated using two-roller belt-drive system . The results obtained using the two finite-element formulations are compared and the convergence of the two finite-element solutions is examined .

__label__sciMet_Optics , The design , realization , and performance analysis of an octupole electrode pattern configuration intended for the optimization of the charge collection efficiency in quartz tuning forks ( QTFs ) vibrating at the first overtone in-plane flexural mode is reported . Two QTFs having the same geometry , but differing in the electrode pattern deposited on the QTF prongs , have been realized in order to study the influence of the electrode pattern on the resonance quality factor and electrical resistance . A standard quadrupole pattern ( optimized for the fundamental mode ) and an octupole electrode layout have been implemented . Although both QTFs show the same resonance quality factor for the first overtone , the octupole pattern provides a reduction of the QTF electrical resistance by more than four times . The sensing performance of the two QTFs has been compared by employing them in a mid-IR quartz-enhanced photoacoustic sensor ( QEPAS ) system targeting a water absorption line . When operating at the first overtone mode , the QTF with an octupole electrode pattern provides a QEPAS signal more than two times higher with respect to the QTF employing the standard quadrupole configuration .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Engineering , Concentrations of CH4 and the rates of processes of its transformation and oxidation are evaluated in the littoral zone of a large polimictic reservoir in the open-water period . The production of CH4 in bottom sediment was found to vary within 0 . 07 to 17 . 32 mmol/ ( m2 day ) and attain its maximum in the late summer . The main factors to control the activity of methanogens were found to be the temperature and the availability of substrates ( acetate and H2/CO2 ) . The newly formed methane was oxidized in the top soil layer with a rate of 0 . 09–17 . 15 mmol/ ( m2 day ) . The rates of processes of biogenic production and consumption of CH4 in silts of screened coast were higher than those in sands of the open coastal zone .

__label__sciMet_Ornithology , Abstract . We investigated the flight altitude of hunting Eleonora ' s Falcons ( Falco eleonorae ) around their colony near the island of Crete ( Greece ) . We used a broadband marine surveillance radar positioned on the coast of Crete and detected the falcons’ movements during the breeding period . The birds were monitored using a Java application that enabled us to manually track radar targets directly on the radar screen and transfer the data into a GIS environment . Thirty hours of radar monitoring between 14 September and 22 September 2017 produced 4774 records of the species ( 1218 over inland and 3556 over the sea ) . Hunting falcons flew on average at 1292 ± 11 masl ( range = 17–3475 , median flight altitude 1156 m ) , though 70% of them were tracked flying between 17 and 1750 m . The range of flight altitude recorded was greater than that previously published , and was consistent with the prey selection during the nestling-rearing period , i . e . , migratory passerines . Eleonora ' s Falcons hunted more frequently over the sea than over the mainland and at a higher altitudes during the morning than at midday or in the afternoon . The daily flight pattern probably reflected the higher intensity of passerine migration in the early morning and late afternoon , as well as an opportunistic prey shift from birds to insects during midday when passerine migration is weak . Compared to other techniques previously used for tracking this species , namely visual observations ( 1970s ) , optical range finder ( 1990s ) , and satellite telemetry ( 2000s ) , broadband marine radar is not limited by small sample size , geolocation error , weather conditions , or poor visibility at high altitudes .

__label__sciMet_Evolutionary_Biology , In the following short lines , I will try to summarize the meaning of the concept ‘‘codon usage , ’’ i . e . , how different organisms , or different tissues from the same organism , use the 59 codons which code for more than one amino acid ( all but AUG and UGG which are the only ones for Met and Trp , respectively , and excluding the stop codons , which are UAA , UAG , and UGA ) . First of all , let us assume that LUCA had what now we call the ‘‘universal genetic code’’ LUCA had a well-developed translation apparatus , which translated the canonical 20 amino acids , had all the tRNAs , and , of course , all the enzymes needed to charge the tRNAs ( aminoacyl tRNA synthetases ) . What happened before that is still a matter of discussion , which is related more to the origin of the genetic code than to codon usage ( Musto 2014 ) . First of all , before the advent of DNA sequencing techniques , codon usage was postulated as selectively neutral , i . e . , given a long enough sequence ( or a big number of CDS ) , each triplet coding for the same amino acid should be equally frequent . That is , for example , given that UUU and UUC code for Phe , both of them should be used at about 50 % . For fourfold degenerate codons , like Pro , CCU , CCA , CCC , and CCG , each of them should be at around 25 % ( King and Jukes 1969 ) . However , as long as many DNA sequences were available , it became evident that this was not the case , mainly by the work of Grantham and his colleagues ( Grantham et al . 1980 , 1981 ) . In their pioneering work , these authors showed two crucial issues first , each genome apparently had its own strategy for the usage of synonymous codons , and second , genes expressed at higher levels tended to display a different codon usage from the rest of the genes from the same genome . The first point could be easily explained by the different mutational bias ( GC-rich organisms tend to use more Gand C-ending triplets , while Aand T-ending codons should be preferred by GC-poor genomes ) . On the other hand , the second point was by far much more complex and involved more biological implications , since it suggested that in highly expressed sequences , natural selection was at action selecting a subset of triplets . At the moment , that was a revolutionary idea , because its main implication was that third-codon positions were the result of natural selection acting at the level of translation . In other words , synonymous codons , at least in a subset of genes , were neither neutral nor silent . Incidentally , this idea , together with other results , inspired one of the most beautiful titles of a review written on the subject several years later ‘‘DNA sequence evolution the sounds of silence’’ ( Sharp et al . 1995 ) . Later , this selectionist hypothesis was confirmed by Ikemura , who showed that in several organisms , the most heavily expressed genes have a tendency to use the codons which match the most frequent tRNAs ( Ikemura 1985 ) . His results , both technically and conceptually , were enormous . Indeed , he found not only that the isoacceptor tRNAs ( i . e . , the different tRNAs which have different anticodons but carry the same amino acid ) are not present at the same concentration within a cell , but also that those which recognize ( following certain rules ) the most frequent codons at the most heavily expressed genes are at the highest concentration . Needless to say , his contribution gave a great impulse to the selectionist theory . Therefore , nothing & Héctor Musto hmusto@gmail . com What We Know and What We Should Know About Codon Usage

__label__sciMet_Evolutionary_Biology , Molecular ecology regularly requires the analysis of count data that reflect the relative abundance of features of a composition ( e . g . , taxa in a community , gene transcripts in a tissue ) . The sampling process that generates these data can be modeled using the multinomial distribution . Replicate multinomial samples inform the relative abundances of features in an underlying Dirichlet distribution . These distributions together form a hierarchical model for relative abundances among replicates and sampling groups . This type of Dirichletmultinomial modelling ( DMM ) has been described previously , but its benefits and limitations are largely untested . With simulated data , we quantified the ability of DMM to detect differences in proportions between treatment and control groups , and compared the efficacy of three computational methods to implement DMM-Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ( HMC ) , variational inference ( VI ) , and Gibbs Markov chain Monte Carlo . We report that DMM was better able to detect shifts in relative abundances than analogous analytical tools , while identifying an acceptably low number of false positives . Among methods for implementing DMM , HMC provided the most accurate estimates of relative abundances , and VI was the most computationally efficient . The sensitivity of DMM was exemplified through analysis of previously published data describing lung microbiomes . We report that DMM identified several potentially pathogenic , bacterial taxa as more abundant in the lungs of children who aspirated foreign material during swallowing these differences went undetected with different statistical approaches . Our results suggest that DMM has strong potential as a statistical method to guide inference in molecular ecology . Dirichlet-multinomial modelling outperforms alternatives for analysis of microbiome and other ecological count data .

__label__sciMet_Optics , To explore the potential of achieving low-stress and high-reflectance Mo/Si multilayers deposited by conventional magnetron sputtering with bias assistance , we investigated the effects of varying Ar gas pressure , substrate bias voltage , and a bias-assisted Si ratio on the stress and extreme ultraviolet ( EUV ) reflectance of Mo/Si multilayers . To reduce the damage of ion bombardments on an Si-on-Mo interface , only the final part of the Si layer was deposited with bias assistance . Bias voltage has strong influence on the stress . The compressive stress of Mo/Si multilayers can be reduced remarkably by increasing bias voltage due to the increase of Mo-on-Si interdiffusion and postponement of Mo crystallization transition . Properly choosing gas pressure and a bias-assisted Si ratio is critical to obtain high EUV reflectance . Appropriately decreasing gas pressure can reduce the interface roughness without increasing interdiffusion . Too much bias assistance can seriously reduce the optical contrast between Mo and Si layers and lead to a remarkable decrease of EUV reflectance . Thus , by appropriately choosing gas pressure , bias voltage , and a bias-assisted Si ratio , the stress values of Mo/Si multilayers can be reduced to the order of -100  MPa with an EUV reflectance loss of about 1% .

__label__sciMet_Electrical_&_Electronic_Engineering , This paper presents an in situ moisture content sensor based on a switched-polarization dipole antenna that detects the magnitude of mutual coupling between perpendicular and parallel polarizations . Three aspects of the sensor development are presented a new closed-form calculation of mutual impedance of perpendicular polarization dipole antenna , an antenna design , and an investigation of performance enhancement . As the sensor detects only the magnitude of mutual coupling , it is low cost and low profile and needs less processing time . Thus , it is suitable for a closed-loop drying system . Our study has shown that the values of the dielectric constants measured by this sensor are comparable to the reference values from the transmission line technique in the previous work . However , there are significant differences in the values of the dielectric loss factors because the structure of the presented sensor is not a closed boundary like the transmission line sensor . Therefore , error compensation has been developed to correct the results . This sensor , in a closed-loop drying system , has shown good performance for in situ monitoring and real-time monitoring . Consequently , it is very suitable for monitoring the moisture content of paddy ( rough rice ) .

__label__sciMet_Meteorology_&_Atmospheric_Sciences , Doppler sodar derived values of the temperature structure parameter CinfTsup2 , the vertical velocity variance ¯′w2 , and the rate of dissipation of turbulent energy ɛ , were measured during unstable conditions above the Lannemezan heterogeneous site . The vertical profiles of these turbulent parameters , normalized by the classical convective scales are compared with those obtained using the same acoustic sounder above an homogeneous site during convective conditions . The typical decrease of CinfTsup2as Z-4/3 is partially verified on the heterogeneous site for the lower levels , CinfTsup2exhibits an increase with Z whereas for the intermediate levels CinfTsup2 . decreases as Z-4/3 . For the upper levels , CinfTsup2increases with Z due to a signal-to-noise ratio lower than 1 . The vertical profiles of ¯′w2 above the two sites are rather similar . However , near the base of the convective inversion Zi , the values measured on the heterogeneous site are more scattered . The same scattering is also observed with the ɛ values moreover , for the lower levels ( Z<0 . 17Zi ) the increase of ɛ as Z decreases is more important at the homogeneous site than at the heterogeneous one . It is suggested that these particular features observed at lower levels above the heterogeneous site are mainly related to a complex local boundary layer induced by the near environment of the sodar ( vegetation and relief ) . étude expérimentale de la couche limite au-dessus d ' un relief modéré proche d ' une chaîne de montagne
__label__sciMet_Optics , Abstract . A simple and efficient phase-unwrapping algorithm based on a rounding procedure and a global least-squares minimization is proposed . Instead of processing the gradient of the wrapped phase , this algorithm operates over the gradient of the phase jumps by a robust and noniterative scheme . Thus , the residue-spreading and over-smoothing effects are reduced . The algorithm’s performance is compared with four well-known phase-unwrapping methods minimum cost network flow ( MCNF ) , fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) , quality-guided , and branch-cut . A computer simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm reaches a high-accuracy level than the MCNF method by a low-computing time similar to the FFT phase-unwrapping method . Moreover , since the proposed algorithm is simple , fast , and user-free , it could be used in metrological interferometric and fringe-projection automatic real-time applications .

__label__sciMet_Mechanical_Engineering_&_Transports , The nonholonomic motion planning of a free-falling cat is investigated . Nonholonomicity arises in a free-falling cat subject to nonintegrable angle velocity constraints or nonintegrable conservation laws . When the total angular momentum is zero , the motion equation of a free-falling cat is established based on the model of two symmetric rigid bodies and conservation of angular momentum . The control of system can be converted to the problem of nonholonomic motion planning for a free-falling cat . Based on Ritz approximation theory , the Gauss-Newton method for motion planning by a falling cat is proposed . The effectiveness of the numerical algorithm is demonstrated through simulation on model of a free-falling cat . Optimal control of nonholonomic motion planning for a free-falling cat
__label__sciMet_General_Physics , It has been hypothesized that stationary scroll wave filaments in cardiac tissue describe a geodesic in a curved space whose metric is the inverse diffusion tensor . Several numerical studies support this hypothesis , but no analytical proof has been provided yet for general anisotropy . In this Letter , we derive dynamic equations for the filament in the case of general anisotropy . These equations are covariant under general spatial coordinate transformations and describe the motion of a stringlike object in a curved space whose metric tensor is the inverse diffusion tensor . Therefore the behavior of scroll wave filaments in excitable media with anisotropy is similar to the one of cosmic strings in a curved universe . Our dynamic equations are valid for thin filaments and for general anisotropy . We show that stationary filaments obey the geodesic equation . Covariant stringlike dynamics of scroll wave filaments in anisotropic cardiac tissue . 
__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , Hydrophilic carbon-functionalized magnetic microspheres coated with chitosan ( Fe ( 3 ) O ( 4 ) @C@CHI ) were synthesized for the first time . The hydrophilic carbonaceous layer on the Fe ( 3 ) O ( 4 ) microspheres was formed by the hydrothermal reaction of Fe ( 3 ) O ( 4 ) microspheres and glucose , and then chitosan was coated on surface of the carbon-functionalized microspheres by an easy zero-length reaction with 1-ethyl-3- ( 3-dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide ( EDC ) and N-hydroxysuccinimide ( NHS ) as cross-linkers . The Fe ( 3 ) O ( 4 ) @C@CHI microspheres were spherical core-shell structure with uniform size at about 400 nm . The microspheres had a high saturation magnetization of 60 . 22 emu g ( -1 ) , which was sufficient for magnetic separation . The Fe ( 3 ) O ( 4 ) @C@CHI microspheres presented good hydrophilic property due to the abundant carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the carbonaceous layer of the microspheres . The successful modification of chitosan on the surface of carbon-functionalized magnetic microspheres was validated by the adsorption of Eriochrome Black T ( EBT ) . The prepared microspheres were applied as magnetic solid-phase extraction materials for extraction of bisphenol A ( BPA ) in aqueous samples . The extraction recoveries of spiked samples were in the range of 99 . 4-102 . 6% with low relative standard deviations of 2 . 8-3 . 9% . The results demonstrated that the novel Fe ( 3 ) O ( 4 ) @C@CHI microspheres were good candidate as magnetic SPE materials for extraction of analytes from aqueous samples . Preparation of hydrophilic carbon-functionalized magnetic microspheres coated with chitosan and application in solid-phase extraction of bisphenol A in aqueous samples .
