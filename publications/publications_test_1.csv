__label__sciMet_Artificial_Intelligence_&_Image_Processing , In infrastructure financed projects , in order to attract private investors , host governments often provide some guarantees . This paper develops a value model of minimum revenue guarantee with multiple-exercise real options under the impact of the emergency incident . The model is applied to infrastructure financed projects using the minimum revenue guarantee under simulation . The simulation results indicate that , before quantifying the value of the minimum revenue guarantee , it is necessary to forecast the jump degree and intensity of the emergency incident , as well as prevent and control risks arising from such emergencies . Otherwise , underestimation of the guarantee value will occur and the government will have to bear huge debt in this condition . We also analyze the dependence of the guaranteed value on the minimum guaranteed revenue level , initial revenue and number of exercise rights . For various conditions , the diagrams of the guaranteed value are also presented . Using jump-diffusion modeling for valuing real options in infrastructure projects

__label__sciMet_Chemical_Physics , A quantitative theory is developed to describe the dynamic surface tension and the adsorption kinetics at a liquid-liquid interface , taking into account the molecular diffusion in both bulk phases and the adsorption isotherm for surfactant on the interface . Asymptotic analytical solutions are obtained in the following finite systems ( i ) a liquid spherical drop , ( ii ) a liquid spherical drop surrounded by a liquid phase , and ( iii ) a liquid spherical drop surrounded by a spherical liquid shell . The behavior of the dynamic surface tension and interfacial adsorption over a wide range of times is predicted for cases ( i ) through ( iii ) . The conditions under which the dynamic surface tension passes through a minimum below the steady state value are found . The theoretical model developed allows a qualitative interpretation of the experimental data obtained for a viscous crude oil containing natural acids after contact with aqueous alkali .

__label__sciMet_Aerospace_&_Aeronautics , A method for finding best channels as the auxiliary channels to cancel the interference components in the main channel in reduced-dimension ( RD ) space-time adaptive processing ( STAP ) is proposed . Motivated by the cross-spectral metric ( CSM ) which evaluates the significance of eigenvectors the significance of each angular-Doppler channel to output signal-to-interference-noise ratio ( SINR ) is evaluated and taken into consideration for the auxiliary channels selection in RD STAP . The proposed algorithm can achieve the best output SINR performance by selecting the best channels as auxiliary channels when the degrees of freedom ( DoFs ) of a STAP system are fixed . It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm allows the dimensionality of the STAP to be reduced much less than the rank of clutter without significant SINR loss . The SINR loss will be less than 3 dB when only one channel is selected as the auxiliary channel under the condition of known clutter covariance matrix . Generally , 3~5 channels are enough even when the clutter covariance matrix is unknown . Consequently , the proposed approach can reduce the requirement of the sample support dramatically .

__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , Despite a growing focus from the academic community , the field of microfluidics has yet to produce many commercial devices for point-of-care ( POC ) diagnostics . One of the main reasons for this is the difficulty in producing low-cost , sensitive , and portable optical detection systems . Although electrochemical methods work well for certain applications , optical detection is generally regarded as superior and is the method most widely employed in laboratory clinical chemistry . Conventional optical systems , however , are costly , require careful alignment , and do not translate well to POC devices . Furthermore , many optical detection paradigms such as absorbance and fluorescence suffer at smaller geometries because the optical path length through the sample is shortened . This review examines the innovative techniques which have recently been developed to address these issues . We highlight microfluidic diagnostic systems which demonstrate practical integration of sample preparation , analyte enrichment , and optical detection . We also examine several emerging detection paradigms involving nanoengineered materials which do not suffer from the same miniaturization disadvantages as conventional measurements . Innovations in optical microfluidic technologies for point-of-care diagnostics .

__label__sciMet_Medicinal_&_Biomolecular_Chemistry , Adenosine 3 ' , 5 ' - and 2 ' , 5 ' -bisphosphates previously were demonstrated to act as competitive antagonists at the P2Y1 receptor ( Boyer et al . Mol . Pharmacol . 1996 , 50 , 1323-1329 ) . 2 ' - and 3 ' -Deoxyadenosine bisphosphate analogues containing various structural modifications at the 2- and 6-positions of the adenine ring , on the ribose moiety , and on the phosphate groups have been synthesized with the goal of developing more potent and selective P2Y1 antagonists . Single-step phosphorylation reactions of adenosine nucleoside precursors were carried out . The activity of each analogue at P2Y1 receptors was determined by measuring its capacity to stimulate phospholipase C in turkey erythrocyte membranes ( agonist effect ) and to inhibit phospholipase C stimulation elicited by 10 nM 2-MeSATP ( antagonist effect ) . Both 2 ' - and 3 ' -deoxy modifications were well tolerated . The N6-methyl modification both enhanced antagonistic potency ( IC50 330 nM ) of 2 ' -deoxyadenosine 3 ' , 5 ' -bisphosphate by 17-fold and eliminated residual agonist properties observed with the lead compounds . The N6-ethyl modification provided intermediate potency as an antagonist , while the N6-propyl group completely abolished both agonist and antagonist properties . 2-Methylthio and 2-chloro analogues were partial agonists of intermediate potency . A 2 ' -methoxy group provided intermediate potency as an antagonist while enhancing agonist activity . An N1-methyl analogue was a weak antagonist with no agonist activity . An 8-bromo substitution and replacement of the N6-amino group with methylthio , chloro , or hydroxy groups greatly reduced the ability to interact with P2Y1 receptors . Benzoylation or dimethylation of the N6-amino group also abolished or greatly diminished the antagonist activity . In summary , our results further define the structure-activity of adenosine bisphosphates as P2Y1 receptor antagonists and have led to the identification of the most potent antagonist reported to date for this receptor . Deoxyadenosine bisphosphate derivatives as potent antagonists at P2Y1 receptors . 
__label__sciMet_Zoology , Abstract We used complete sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to test monophyly of the Sparoidea , Sparidae , six subfamilies of Sparidae , and to elucidate the interrelationships of the 33 recognized sparid genera . The analysis included 40 sparid species , 10 closely related species , 10 basal percoids , and two nonperciform outgroup species . The aligned 1140 base pairs of cytochrome b yielded 542 parsimony informative characters . Mutational analysis revealed that third codon position transitions were saturated and , therefore , of questionable use in phylogenetic analysis . However , the third codon position transversions and all first and second codon substitutions were not saturated and thus judged more reliable for inferring evolutionary relationship . Parsimony analysis of the equally weighted nucleotide data , weighted nucleotide data set ( saturated position transitions given a weight of zero ) supported a monophyletic Sparidae with the inclusion of Spicara , which is traditionally included in Centracanthidae . The previously proposed composition of genera within the six sparid subfamilies ( Boopsinae , Denticinae , Diplodinae , Pagellinae , Pagrinae , and Sparinae ) were not monophyletic in all analyses . This suggests the feeding types on which the subfamilies are based were independently derived multiple times within sparid fishes . In all analyses , Lethrinidae were sister to Sparidae . Sparoidea ( Sparidae , Centracanthidae , Lethrinidae , and Nemipteridae ) were monophyletic only in the weighted nucleotide phylogeny .

At that time , this technique was also proposed for use in immunoisolation of endocrine cells , islets , and hepatocytes as hybrid artificial organs . Progress in the biotechnology of cell culture in the last 10 years has allowed this approach to be extensively investigated by an increasing number of centers .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , PurposeStripping contaminants from sediments with granular activated carbon ( GAC ) is a promising remediation technique in which the effectiveness depends on the rate of contaminant extraction from the sediment by the GAC . The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of mixing intensity on the short-term extraction rate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) from contaminated sediment . Materials and methodsPAH desorption from sediment at a wide range of rotational speeds ( min−1 rotations per minute ( rpm ) ) was monitored by uptake in Tenax polymeric resins using a completely mixed batch reactor . Desorption data were interpreted using a radial diffusion model . Desorption parameters obtained with the radial diffusion model were correlated with particle size measurements and interpreted mechanistically . Results and discussionFast desorption rate constants , De/r2 , with De the effective diffusion coefficient and r the particle radius , ranged from 3 . 7 × 10−3 to 1 . 1 × 10−1 day−1 ( PHE ) and 6 × 10−6 to 1 . 9 × 10−4 day−1 ( CHR ) , respectively , and increased with the intensity of mixing . The De/r2 values would correspond to De ranges of 1 . 8 × 10−14–1 . 2 × 10−16 m2 × day−1 and 1 . 8 × 10−12–3 . 7 × 10−15 m2 × day−1 , assuming fast desorption from the measured smallest particle size ( 9 μm ) classes at 200 and 600 rpm , respectively . ConclusionsDesorption of PAHs was significantly accelerated by a reduction of particle aggregate size caused by shear forces that were induced by mixing . The effective intra-particle diffusion coefficients , De , were larger at higher mixing rates . Turbulent mixing accelerates PAH desorption due to fragmentation of sediment particle aggregates

__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , Breath gas analysis is a novel powerful technique for noninvasive , early-stage diagnosis of metabolic disorders or diseases . Molecular hydrogen and methane are biomarkers for colonic fermentation , because of malabsorption of oligosaccharides ( e . g . , lactose or fructose ) and for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth . Recently , the presence of these gases in exhaled breath was also correlated with obesity . Here , we report on the highly selective and sensitive detection of molecular hydrogen and methane within a complex gas mixture ( consisting of H2 , CH4 , N2 , O2 , and CO2 ) by means of fiber-enhanced Raman spectroscopy ( FERS ) . An elaborate FERS setup with a microstructured hollow core photonic crystal fiber ( HCPCF ) provided a highly improved analytical sensitivity . The simultaneous monitoring of H2 with all other gases was achieved by a combination of rotational ( H2 ) and vibrational ( other gases ) Raman spectroscopy within the limited spectral transmission range of the HCPCF . The HCPCF was combined with an adjustable image-plane aperture pinhole , in order to separate the H2 rotational Raman bands from the silica background signal and improve the sensitivity down to a limit of detection ( LOD ) of 4 . 7 ppm ( for only 26 fmol H2 ) . The ability to monitor the levels of H2 and CH4 in a positive hydrogen breath test ( HBT ) was demonstrated . The FERS sensor possesses a high dynamic range ( ∼5 orders of magnitude ) with a fast response time of few seconds and provides great potential for miniaturization . We foresee that this technique will pave the way for fast , noninvasive , and painless point-of-care diagnosis of metabolic diseases in exhaled human breath .

__label__sciMet_Industrial_Engineering_&_Automation , In this brief , consensus modified positive position feedback ( CMPPF ) is proposed to depress the vibration of large flexible structure in the spacecraft . CMPPF is formulated by decentralizing and distributing the modified positive position feedback ( MPPF ) to a network of control agents . Variables are appropriately selected and the consensus algorithm is employed to make the multiagents consensus with each other . CMPPF convergence conditions are derived and the control parameters are optimized . Amplitude-frequency response analysis and simulations demonstrate that CMPPF suppresses vibrations faster and more evidently than MPPF . Results also indicate how consensus between agents is realized and how agents’ disagreement is eliminated . Effects of different consensus variables and different communication topologies are studied . Meanwhile , results for different types of agents’ failure are presented .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Engineering , Unser heutiges Bild von der Natur als Ökosystem ist jünger als viele meinen . Auch wenn der Begriff „Nachhaltigkeit“ schon vor ca . 300 Jahren in der Forstwirtschaft geprägt wurde , galt die Natur lange nur als Lieferant unerschöpflicher Rohstoffe . Der edle Wilde oder ein Leben der Urvölker im Einklang mit der Natur sind Mythen aus der Neuzeit . Erst mit den sozialen Bewegungen ( Arbeiter , Bauern , Frauen ) im 19 . Jh . entwickelt sich der Schutzgedanke zur Erhaltung von Erholungsräumen für die arbeitende Bevölkerung . Mit der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung und der rasanten Erweiterung der wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse musste sich auch der Naturschutz wandeln . Nicht nur zum Umweltschutz oder Ökosystemschutz , sondern auch zu einer ganzheitlichen Betrachtung , die neben Ökologie auch Ökonomie und Soziologie mit einbezieht . Diese drei Säulen tragen den Begriff der Nachhaltigkeit , wie wir ihn heute verstehen . Zu dieser neuen Betrachtung gehört auch der früher einmal als Lebensraum aus zweiter Hand bezeichnete dynamische Naturschutz . Im Gegensatz zu einem stationären oder Panoramanaturschutz , der jeglichen menschlichen Eingriff auch in Kulturlandschaften ablehnt , sollen im Interesse des gesamten Ökosystems verbessernde und vorhandene Wunden heilende Eingriffe unvermeidbare Schäden beseitigen . Dieser moderne Naturschutz braucht allerdings das Fachwissen der Ökologen , um Effizienz und Verträglichkeit im Ökosystem sicherzustellen . Der österreichische Verein für Ökologie und Umweltforschung ( VÖU ) , eine seit 30 Jahren bestehende Dialogplattform für Energieund Umweltthemen , freut sich über die Mitwirkung am 3 . Symposium zum technischen Monitoring von Fischen ( StMF ) , welches wir gemeinsam mit I AM HYDRO ( Investigation and Monitoring of Hydrosystems GmbH ) und der TIWAG-Tiroler Wasserkraft AG ausrichten konnten . Dieses Symposium wurde 2014 von I AM HYDRO ins Leben gerufen , um im Bereich des technischen Monitorings von Fischen eine Plattform zum Austausch von Wissen , Ideen , Möglichkeiten und Kontakten zu bieten .

__label__sciMet_Evolutionary_Biology , Convergent evolution of tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) resistance , at both the phenotypic and genetic levels , characterizes coevolutionary arms races between amphibians and their snake predators around the world , and reveals remarkable predictability in the process of adaptation . Here we examine the repeatability of the evolution of TTX resistance in an undescribed predator–prey relationship between TTX-bearing Eastern Newts ( Notophthalmus viridescens ) and Eastern Hog-nosed Snakes ( Heterodon platirhinos ) . We found that that local newts contain levels of TTX dangerous enough to dissuade most predators , and that Eastern Hog-nosed Snakes within newt range are highly resistant to TTX . In fact , these populations of Eastern Hog-nosed Snakes are so resistant to TTX that the potential for current reciprocal selection might be limited . Unlike all other cases of TTX resistance in vertebrates , H . platirhinos lacks the adaptive amino acid substitutions in the skeletal muscle sodium channel that reduce TTX binding , suggesting that physiological resistance in Eastern Hog-nosed Snakes is conferred by an alternate genetic mechanism . Thus , phenotypic convergence in this case is not due to parallel molecular evolution , indicating that there may be more than one way for this adaptation to arise , even among closely related species . Is there more than one way to skin a newt ? Convergent toxin resistance in snakes is not due to a common genetic mechanism
__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , Opioids are well known , widely used painkillers . Increased stability of opioids in the dried blood spot ( DBS ) matrix compared to blood/plasma has been described . Other benefits provided by DBS techniques include point-of-care collection , less invasive micro sampling , more economical shipment , and convenient storage . Current methodology for analysis of micro whole blood samples for opioids is limited to the classical DBS workflow , including tedious manual punching of the DBS cards followed by extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) bioanalysis . The goal of this study was to develop and validate a fully automated on-line sample preparation procedure for the analysis of DBS micro samples relevant to the detection of opioids in finger prick blood . To this end , automated flow-through elution of DBS cards was followed by on-line solid-phase extraction ( SPE ) and analysis by LC-MS/MS . Selective , sensitive , accurate , and reproducible quantitation of five representative opioids in human blood at sub-therapeutic , therapeutic , and toxic levels was achieved . The range of reliable response ( R ( 2 )  ≥0 . 997 ) was 1 to 500 ng/mL whole blood for morphine , codeine , oxycodone , hydrocodone and 0 . 1 to 50 ng/mL for fentanyl . Inter-day , intra-day , and matrix inter-lot accuracy and precision was less than 15% ( even at lower limits of quantitation ( LLOQ ) level ) . The method was successfully used to measure hydrocodone and its major metabolite norhydrocodone in incurred human samples . Our data support the enormous potential of DBS sampling and automated analysis for monitoring opioids as well as other pharmaceuticals in both anti-doping and pain management regimens .

__label__sciMet_Biomedical_Engineering , The proportion of heart transplant recipients bridged with durable , intracorporeal left ventricular assist devices ( dLVADs ) has dramatically increased however , concern exists regarding obligate repeat sternotomy , increased bleeding risk because of anticoagulation and acquired von Willebrand disease , and increased rates of allosensitization . Whether dLVAD patients have impaired posttransplant outcomes compared with equivalent patients with less invasive intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation ( IABP ) at the time of transplant is unknown . Therefore , we analyzed adult , first time , heart-only transplant procedures with dLVAD ( n = 2 , 636 ) compared with IABP ( n = 571 ) at the time of transplant based on data from the United Network for Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) July 2004 to December 2011 . There was clear geographic variation in IABP and dLVAD at transplant . Multivariable analysis demonstrated equivalent cumulative risk of death ( adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratio , 1 . 08 95% confidence interval , 0 . 87-1 . 33 p = 0 . 51 ) . There was no significant difference in adjusted comparison of perioperative morality , length of stay , postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis , or early acute rejection ( p ≥ 0 . 14 for all ) . Therefore , data from UNOS suggest that the presence of dLVAD at the time of heart transplantation does not have a detrimental effect on postoperative outcomes compared with IABP , which must be considered in the context of pretransplant mortality and locoregional organ availability .

__label__sciMet_Entomology , Serine proteases play vital roles in several biological processes such as development and immunity . We have characterized Graal , a large multi-domain serine protease from Drosophila . Graal is spliced in at least three transcripts that are present throughout development . The domains found in Graal proteins are chitin-binding domains ( CBD ) , scavenger receptor cysteine-rich ( SRCR ) domains , low density lipoprotein receptor cysteine-rich ( LDLR-CR ) domains , histidine and proline-rich domains , a NGGYQPP-repeat domain and a serine protease domain . The last 2370 nucleotides of these RNAs are identical and encode a His-rich domain , two SRCR domains , two LDLR-CR domains and a protease domain . The transcription of graal is upregulated after fungal or bacterial infection . Analysis of the Iso1 ( y cn , sp , bw ) strain shows that graal transcription is impaired in this fly line due to the insertion of a retrotransposon in the sixth exon . However , no phenotype could be observed consecutive to the absence of graal full length transcripts , particularly in the context of an immune challenge . graal a Drosophila gene coding for several mosaic serine proteases . 
__label__sciMet_Evolutionary_Biology , Ectoparasites are abundant in natural communities , can have pronounced deleterious fitness consequences to their host and are important vectors of transmissible parasitic disease . Yet very few studies have estimated the magnitude of heritable genetic variation underlying resistance against ectoparasitism , which significantly limits our ability to predict the evolution of this ecologically important character . The present paper reports results of artificial selection for increased resistance in Drosophila nigrospiracula against ectoparasitic , haematophagous mites , Macrocheles subbadius . In this system , which occurs naturally in the Sonoran Desert of North America , ectoparasitism significantly damages the expression of host fitness traits , including longevity , fecundity and male mating success . In the present study , resistance , which was modelled as a threshold trait , responded significantly to selection applied on either sex . Realized heritability , calculated as a mean across four replicates , was estimated to be 0 . 152 +/- 0 . 014 ( SE ) . The heritability estimate from selection on males did not differ from that on females , but both estimates differed significantly from zero . This documented presence of additive genetic variation for resistance , coupled with knowledge of the fitness consequences of ectoparasitism , indicates that the host population possesses significant evolutionary potential . Selection was applied on the pre-attachment phase , thereby targeting behavioural forms of defence . This study therefore establishes parallels between insects and other animals in their ability to protect themselves and evolve behavioural defences against ectoparasites .

__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , Mass spectrometric imaging ( MSI ) has emerged as a powerful technique to obtain spatial arrangement of individual molecular ions in animal tissues . Ambient desorption electrospray ionization ( DESI ) technique is uniquely suited for such imaging experiments , as it can be performed on animal tissues in their native environment without prior treatments . Although MSI has become a rapid growing technique for localization of proteins , lipids , drugs , and endogenous compounds in different tissues , quantification of imaged targets has not been explored extensively . Here we present a novel MSI approach for localization and quantification of drugs in animal thin tissue sections . DESI-MSI using an Orbitrap mass analyzer in full scan mode was performed on 6 μm coronal brain sections from rats that were administered 2 . 5 mg/kg clozapine . Clozapine was localized and quantified in individual brain sections 45 min postdose . External calibration curves were prepared by micropipetting standards with internal standard ( IS ) on top of the tissues , and average response factors were calculated for the scans in which both clozapine and IS were detected . All response factors were normalized to area units . Quantifications from DESI-MSI revealed 0 . 2-1 . 2 ng of clozapine in individual brain sections , results that were further confirmed by extraction and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry ( LC/MS/MS ) analysis .

__label__sciMet_Software_Engineering , Background . The ability to predict defect-prone software components would be valuable . Consequently , there have been many empirical studies to evaluate the performance of different techniques endeavouring to accomplish this effectively . However no one technique dominates and so designing a reliable defect prediction model remains problematic . Objective . We seek to make sense of the many conflicting experimental results and understand which factors have the largest effect on predictive performance . Method . We conduct a meta-analysis of all relevant , high quality primary studies of defect prediction to determine what factors influence predictive performance . This is based on 42 primary studies that satisfy our inclusion criteria that collectively report 600 sets of empirical prediction results . By reverse engineering a common response variable we build a random effects ANOVA model to examine the relative contribution of four model building factors ( classifier , data set , input metrics and researcher group ) to model prediction performance . Results . Surprisingly we find that the choice of classifier has little impact upon performance ( 1 . 3 percent ) and in contrast the major ( 31 percent ) explanatory factor is the researcher group . It matters more who does the work than what is done . Conclusion . To overcome this high level of researcher bias , defect prediction researchers should ( i ) conduct blind analysis , ( ii ) improve reporting protocols and ( iii ) conduct more intergroup studies in order to alleviate expertise issues . Lastly , research is required to determine whether this bias is prevalent in other applications domains . Researcher Bias The Use of Machine Learning in Software Defect Prediction
__label__sciMet_Organic_Chemistry , We report the first use of a rhodium ( II ) dimer in visible light photoredox catalysis , for the aerobic oxidation of arylboronic acids to phenols under mild conditions . Spectroscopic and computational studies indicate that the catalyst Rh2 ( bpy ) 2 ( OAc ) 4 ( 1 ) undergoes metal-metal to ligand charge transfer ( MMLCT ) upon visible light irradiation , which is responsible for catalytic activity . Further reactivity studies demonstrate that 1 is a general photoredox catalyst for diverse oxidation reactions .

__label__sciMet_Applied_Physics , Negative capacitance ( NC ) shows great potential to enable transistors with the steeper slope , which is very useful for voltage/power applications . Black phosphorus ( BP ) is theoretically predicted as good channel materials for NC-FETs . However , the experimental demonstration of BP has so far remained elusive . Here , for the first time , NC transistors based on BP have been demonstrated . By connecting to a 20-nm HfZrO ferroelectric capacitor , both two types of BP transistors show lower subthreshold slope ( SS ) . For 5-nm AlOx BP transistor , the SS decreases from 200 to 104 mV/dec . The experimental results are analyzed with the BP-NCFET model , and the calculated transfer curve can fit well with the experimental curve , which proves the validation of the model . Our work sheds light on using NC BP FETs for low-power flexible electronics applications . Negative Capacitance Black Phosphorus Transistors With Low SS
__label__sciMet_Entomology , Occasionally , the Journal of Chemical Ecology devotes an entire issue to a single topic . Past instances included the September 2000 issue [Vol . 26 ( 9 ) ] that focused on Allelopathy and the October 2002 issue [28 ( 10 ) ] that dealt with Aquatic Chemical Ecology . Plans for a special issue devoted to Molecular Chemical Ecology have been in place for over three years . Early discussions with Linda Walling of the Editorial Board , Associate Editor , Kelsey Downum , and past Associate Editors , Walter Leal and Nancy Targett convinced me that the Journal should aggressively recruit research papers in this area and showcase them in a special issue . The project stumbled along for a while with little progress . Despite two “calls for papers” and tentative commitments by some to write mini-reviews , we did not make significant headway until earlier this year . It was then that Editorial Board member Steve Seybold agreed to take the lead in soliciting timely reviews , and a number of us actively solicited papers from important laboratories working with molecular tools . By arbitrarily setting the final date for December , 2004 , and agreeing to “go” with whatever quality papers we had by September , the issue miraculously came together . Unlike our goals for special issues in the past—in the case of “allelopathy” to feature the best papers from the International World Congress and to establish guidelines and models for quality papers in an effort to advance the field—and in the case of the “aquatic” issue to showcase important work and to help define the “state of the art” in a sub-discipline just beginning to flourish—the goal this time was different . Our aim here is both to educate our readership about important chemical ecological questions that are being attacked , the answers that are emerging , and the resulting challenges and opportunities that come with molecular work , and also to broaden the scientific base of the papers that the Journal publishes . A lot of people are acknowledged for their efforts Steve Seybold for taking the lead Linda Walling for helping with planning several past and present Editorial Board members for encouragement including May Berenbaum , Wilhelm Boland , Marcel Dicke , Wittko Francke , Jonathan Gershenzon , Thomas Hartmann , John Hildebrand , Walter Leal , Jocelyn Millar , James Nation , John Pickett , Coby Schal , and Nancy Targett and finally , many International Society of Chemical Ecology Letter from the Editor-in-chief
__label__sciMet_Organic_Chemistry , Vitamins are hypothesized to be relics of an RNA world , and were probably participants in RNA-mediated primordial metabolism . If catalytic RNAs , or ribozymes , could harness vitamin cofactors to aid their function in a manner similar to protein enzymes , it would enable them to catalyse a much larger set of chemical reactions . The cofactor thiamin diphosphate , a derivative of vitamin B1 ( thiamin ) , is used by enzymes to catalyse difficult metabolic reactions , including decarboxylation of stable α-keto acids such as pyruvate . Here , we report a ribozyme that uses free thiamin to decarboxylate a pyruvate-based suicide substrate ( LnkPB ) . Thiamin conjugated to biotin was used to isolate catalytic individuals from a pool of random-sequence RNAs attached to LnkPB . Analysis of a stable guanosine adduct obtained via digestion of an RNA sequence ( clone dc4 ) showed the expected decarboxylation product . The discovery of a prototypic thiamin-utilizing ribozyme has implications for the role of RNA in orchestrating early metabolic cycles . A thiamin-utilizing ribozyme decarboxylates a pyruvate-like substrate . 
__label__sciMet_Polymers , Nanocrystalline cellulose ( NCC ) reinforced alginate-based nanocomposite film was prepared by solution casting . The NCC content in the matrix was varied from 1 to 8% ( ( w/w ) % dry matrix ) . It was found that the nanocomposite reinforced with 5 wt% NCC content exhibits the highest tensile strength which was increased by 37% compared to the control . Incorporation of NCC also significantly improved water vapor permeability ( WVP ) of the nanocomposite showing a 31% decrease due to 5 wt% NCC loading . Molecular interactions between alginate and NCC were supported by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy . The X-ray diffraction studies also confirmed the appearance of crystalline peaks due to the presence of NCC inside the films . Thermal stability of alginate-based nanocomposite films was improved after incorporation of NCC . Nanocrystalline cellulose ( NCC ) reinforced alginate based biodegradable nanocomposite film . 
__label__sciMet_Applied_Physics , A general model for the coupled analysis of magneto-mechanical systems is developed by minimizing the continuum energy functional of the system using the calculus of variation . This approach , which is in contrast with the traditional approach of minimizing after discretization , allows the use of strain and stress tensors , vector identities and the divergence theorem , and results in coupled governing equations of the system with three coupling terms the magnetic stress tensor , the magnetostriction stress tensor , and the magnetostriction reluctivity . The model uses the information contained in the set of experimental magnetostriction curves dependent on stress to calculate the permeability variation due to stress . The governing equations are then discretized using the Galerkin method resulting in methods for the calculation of nodal magnetic and magnetostriction forces including the coupling effects . Finally the model is applied to a simple 2D problem and the flux density distributions using the proposed method and the traditional method of using experimental magnetization curves are compared .

__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , The effect of the nature of β-diketones on the spectrochemical-luminescence properties of lanthanide complexes used as analytical forms for the highly sensitive determination of some rare-earth elements was examined . NMR spectroscopy , molecular mechanics , calculations , and an experimental evaluation of the hydrophobicity of the test β-diketones indicated that an increase in the intensity , quantum yield , and lifetime of luminescence of lanthanide ( Ln ) β-diketonates depends on the charge distribution in the chelate ring , on the spatial structure , and on the hydrophobicity of the coordinated ligand . These factors determine the efficiency of energy transfer from the β-diketone to the Ln+3 ion and the decrease in energy losses caused by the quenching action of water molecules . Relationship between the analytical properties of lanthanide ( III ) βdiketonates and the nature of ligands
__label__sciMet_General_Mathematics , The Fomin–Kirillov algebra $${\mathcal {E}}_n$$En is a noncommutative quadratic algebra with a generator for every edge of the complete graph on n vertices . For any graph G on n vertices , we define $${{\mathcal {E}}_G}$$EG to be the subalgebra of $${\mathcal {E}}_n$$En generated by the edges of G . We show that these algebras have many parallels with Coxeter groups and their nil-Coxeter algebras for instance , $${\mathcal {E}}_G$$EG is a free $${\mathcal {E}}_H$$EH-module for any $$H\subseteq G$$H⊆G , and if $${\mathcal {E}}_G$$EG is finite-dimensional , then its Hilbert series has symmetric coefficients . We determine explicit monomial bases and Hilbert series for $${\mathcal {E}}_G$$EG when G is a simply laced finite Dynkin diagram or a cycle , in particular showing that $${\mathcal {E}}_G$$EG is finite-dimensional in these cases . We also present conjectures for the Hilbert series of $${\mathcal {E}}_{\tilde{D}_n}$$ED~n , $${\mathcal {E}}_{\tilde{E}_6}$$EE~6 , and $${\mathcal {E}}_{\tilde{E}_7}$$EE~7 , as well as the graphs G on six vertices for which $$\mathcal {E}_G$$EG is finite-dimensional .

__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , __label__KEYWORDS_DNA_sequences , We present a newly developed technique for the direct detection of very low concentrations of specific nucleic acid sequences in homogeneous solution based on a polymerase extension reaction . This method consists of synthesizing a highly fluorescent nucleic acid reporter molecule using a sequence of the target as a template . Synthesis of the reporter molecule is accomplished by hybridizing a short complementary oligonucleotide primer to the target and extending the reporter using a polymerase and free nucleotides . One of these nucleotides is partially labeled with a fluorophore . The reaction sample is then flowed through the capillary cell of a single molecule detector . Detection of the reporter signifies the presence of the target being sought . Under carefully selected conditions , fluorescence from the reporter molecule is much stronger than that of the free nucleotide background over the detection time . We have derived practical equations that allow us to determine an optimal range of values for the relative reporter and free-nucleotide concentrations . This method allows for the rapid , direct detection of individual targets at femtomolar concentrations without the use of an amplification procedure , such as the polymerase chain reaction . Ultrasensitive detection of DNA sequences in solution by specific enzymatic labeling . 
__label__sciMet_Numerical_&_Computational_Mathematics , We analyse both theoretically and numerically a nonlinear model of the dynamics of a cell population divided into proliferative and quiescent compartments that is described in [F . Bekkal Brikci , J . Clairambault , B . Ribba , B . Perthame , An age-and-cyclin-structured cell population model with proliferation and quiescence , INRIA Research Report No 5941 , 2006] . It is a physiological age and molecule-structured population model for the cell division cycle , which aims at representing both healthy and tumoral tissues . A noticeable feature of this model is to exhibit tissue homeostasis for healthy tissue and unlimited growth for tumoral tissue . In particular , the present paper analyses model parameters for which a tumoral tissue exhibits polynomial growth and not mere exponential growth . Polynomial tumour growth has been recently advocated by several authors , on the basis either of experimental observations or of individual cell-based simulations which take space limitations into account . This model is able to take such polynomial growth behaviour into account without considerations of space , by proposing exchange functions between the proliferative and quiescent compartments .

__label__sciMet_Meteorology_&_Atmospheric_Sciences , We report on the development and current capabilities of the ALOMAR Rayleigh/Mie/Raman lidar . This instrument is one of the core instruments of the international ALOMAR facility , located near Andenes in Norway at 69°N and 16°E . The major task of the instrument is to perform advanced studies of the Arctic middle atmosphere over altitudes between about 15 to 90 km on a climatological basis . These studies address questions about the thermal structure of the Arctic middle atmosphere , the dynamical processes acting therein , and of aerosols in the form of stratospheric background aerosol , polar stratospheric clouds , noctilucent clouds , and injected aerosols of volcanic or anthropogenic origin . Furthermore , the lidar is meant to work together with other remote sensing instruments , both ground- and satellite-based , and with balloon- and rocket-borne instruments performing in situ observations . The instrument is basically a twin lidar , using two independent power lasers and two tiltable receiving telescopes . The power lasers are Nd YAG lasers emitting at wavelengths 1064 , 532 , and 355 nm and producing 30 pulses per second each . The power lasers are highly stabilized in both their wavelengths and the directions of their laser beams . The laser beams are emitted into the atmosphere fully coaxial with the line-of-sight of the receiving telescopes . The latter use primary mirrors of 1 . 8 m diameter and are tiltable within 30° off zenith . Their fields-of-view have 180 μrad angular diameter . Spectral separation , filtering , and detection of the received photons are made on an optical bench which carries , among a multitude of other optical components , three double Fabry-Perot interferometers ( two for 532 and one for 355 nm ) and one single Fabry-Perot interferometer ( for 1064 nm ) . A number of separate detector channels also allow registration of photons which are produced by rotational-vibrational and rotational Raman scatter on N2 and N2+O2 molecules , respectively . Currently , up to 36 detector channels simultaneously record the photons collected by the telescopes . The internal and external instrument operations are automated so that this very complex instrument can be operated by a single engineer . Currently the lidar is heavily used for measurements of temperature profiles , of cloud particle properties such as their altitude , particle densities and size distributions , and of stratospheric winds . Due to its very effective spectral and spatial filtering , the lidar has unique capabilities to work in full sunlight . Under these conditions it can measure temperatures up to 65 km altitude and determine particle size distributions of overhead noctilucent clouds . Due to its very high mechanical and optical stability , it can also employed efficiently under marginal weather conditions when data on the middle atmosphere can be collected only through small breaks in the tropospheric cloud layers .

__label__sciMet_Medicinal_&_Biomolecular_Chemistry , Curcumin is the major constituent of turmeric ( Curcuma longa ) . Turmeric has been widely used as a spice in foods and for therapeutic applications such as anti-inflammatory , antihyperlipidemic , and antimicrobial activities . Turmeric and curcumin are nonmutagenic and nongenotoxic . Oral use of turmeric and curcumin did not have reproductive toxicity in animals at certain doses . Studies on human did not show toxic effects , and curcumin was safe at the dose of 6 g/day orally for 4-7 weeks . However , some adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upsets may occur . Moreover , oral bioavailable formulations of curcumin were safe for human at the dose of 500 mg two times in a day for 30 days , but there are still few trials and more studies are needed specially on nanoformulations and it should be discussed in a separate article . In addition , curcumin is known as a generally recognized as safe substance . This review discusses the safety and toxicity of turmeric and curcumin in medicine .

__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , SummaryThe response of the common wheat line ‘Chinese Spring’ to heat shocks of different time lengths was studied by the two-dimensional ( 2D ) electrophoresis of denatured proteins . After a heat shock of 5 h , 33 heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) accumulated in an amount sufficient to be revealed by silver stain . Two other wheat lines ( ‘Moisson’ and ‘Selkirk’ ) were then submitted to a heat shock of 5 h , and the responses of the 3 lines were compared of a total of 35 HSPs , 13 ( 37 . 1% ) were quantitatively or qualitatively variable . This variability concerns low-molecular-weight and high-molecular-weight HSPs . The three genotypes showed thermal tolerance but ‘Chinese Spring ' s’ response to heat treatments was slightly different from those of the other two lines The possibility of a relationship between HSP patterns and thermal sensitivity is discussed .

__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , Carbon and nitrogen are the two most abundant nutrient elements for all living organisms , and their metabolism is tightly coupled . What are the signaling mechanisms that cells use to sense and control the carbon/nitrogen ( C/N ) metabolic balance following environmental changes ? Based on studies in cyanobacteria , it was found that 2-phosphoglycolate derived from the oxygenase activity of Rubisco ( ribulose-1 , 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase ) and 2-oxoglutarate from the Krebs cycle act as the carbon- and nitrogen-starvation signals , respectively , and their concentration ratio likely reflects the status of the C/N metabolic balance . We will present and discuss the regulatory principles underlying the signaling mechanisms , which are likely to be conserved in other photosynthetic organisms . These concepts may also contribute to developments in the field of biofuel engineering or improvements in crop productivity . Carbon/Nitrogen Metabolic Balance Lessons from Cyanobacteria .

__label__sciMet_Networking_&_Telecommunications , Thermomechanical reliability of solder joints in flip-chip packages is usually analyzed by assuming a homogeneous underfill ignoring the settling of filler particles . However , filler settling does impact flip chip reliability . This paper reports a numerical study of the influence of filler settling on the fatigue estimation of flip-chip solder joints . In total , nine underfill materials ( 35 vol% silica filler in three epoxies with three filler settling profiles for each epoxy ) are individually introduced in a 2-D finite element ( FE ) model to compare the thermal response of flip chip solder joints that are surrounded by the underfill . The results show that the fatigue indicators for the solder joints ( inelastic shear strain increments and inelastic shear strain energy density ) corresponding to a gradual , nonuniform filler profile studied in this paper can be smaller than those associated with the uniform filler profile , suggesting that certain gradual filler settling profiles in conjunction with certain resin grades may favor a longer solder fatigue lifetime . The origin of this intriguing observation is in the fact that the solder fatigue indicators are a function of the thermal mismatch among the die , substrate , solder , and underfill materials . The thermal mechanics interplayed among these materials along with a gradual filler profile may allow for minimizing thermal mismatch and thus lead to lower fatigue indicators . Dependence of Flip Chip Solder Reliability on Filler Settling
__label__sciMet_Marine_Biology_&_Hydrobiology , We examined deep-sea epibenthic sledge isopod data from the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean ( SO ) ( depth range=742–5 , 191 m ) . Samples were taken during the expeditions EASIZ II ( ANT XV-3 ) in 1998 and ANDEEP I and II ( ANT XIX3/4 ) in 2002 . A total of 471 isopod species were recorded from 28 sites . The species richness of the epibenthic sledge samples was highly variable ( 6–82 species ) . Species richness was highest at site 131-3 in 3 , 053 m depth in the north-eastern Weddell Sea . The highest numbers of species were sampled in the middle depth range and lower species richness was found in the shallower and deeper parts of the study area . Depth is suggested to explain isopod species richness better than both latitude and longitude . Between 58°S and 65°S , the number of species ranged from 9 to 82 ( mean=35 . 9 ) . Further south in the Weddell Sea , between 73°S and 74°S , species richness was lower and the number of species ranged from 6 to 35 ( mean=19 . 2 ) . With regard to longitude , the highest species richness ( up to 82 species ) was found between 50°W and 60°W in the area of the South Shetland Islands and around the Antarctic Peninsula , while numbers did not exceed 50 species in the eastern Weddell Sea . The haul length , ranging from 807 to 6 , 464 m , was positively correlated with depth however , there was no linear relationship between haul length and species richness . We therefore suggest that depth was the most important factor explaining isopod species richness . However , only 28 sites were visited and the statistical power is thus limited . Sampling in the deep sea is expensive and time consuming and as yet this is the best isopod data set available from the Atlantic sector of the SO . Future expeditions are therefore important to better explain the current patterns of benthic diversity in Antarctica .

__label__sciMet_General_Chemistry , 2H-NbSe ( 2 ) is a canonical Charge-Density-Wave ( CDW ) layered material the structural details of which remained elusive . We report the detailed structure of 2H-NbSe ( 2 ) below the CDW transition using a ( 3 + 2 ) -dimensional crystallographic approach on single crystal X-ray diffraction data collected at 15 K . Intensities of main reflections as well as CDW satellites of first order were measured . Quantitative information about the magnitude of the structural distortions and clustering of Nb atoms were extracted from the refined model .

__label__sciMet_Inorganic_&_Nuclear_Chemistry , Hydrogenation of maleic anhydride ( MA ) to succinic anhydride ( SA ) over Ni/clay catalysts prepared by an impregnation method has been studied at different temperatures , Ni contents , pressures and weighted hourly space velocity ( WHSV ) . The catalytic activity was greatly influenced by the temperature , Ni content , WHSV and pressure . A 97 . 1 % MA conversion with 99 . 6 % selectivity to SA was obtained over 5 %wt catalyst at 180 °C and at a pressure of 1 MPa H2 . The catalysts were characterized by an array of techniques , including X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , H2 temperature-programmed reduction ( TPR ) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) . XRD and TPR studies showed that nickel was present as Ni2+ species on the support . Increasing the calcination temperature up to 650 °C led to the destruction of the support structure , as observed by TGA , while a calcination temperature of 550 °C gave the best results . Catalyst deactivation studies showed that the catalyst has a long lifetime , the yield of SA remaining better than 90 % even after a reaction time of 60 h . Studies on the catalyst induction showed that the presence or absence of an induction period was determined by the type of hydrogenation catalyst .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , The removal capacity of toxic heavy metals by the reused eggshell was studied . As a pretreatment process for the preparation of reused material from waste eggshell , calcination was performed in the furnace at 800 degrees C for 2 h after crushing the dried waste eggshell . Calcination behavior , qualitative and quantitative elemental information , mineral type and surface characteristics before and after calcination of eggshell were examined by thermal gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , X-ray fluorescence ( XRF ) , X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , respectively . After calcination , the major inorganic composition was identified as Ca ( lime , 99 . 63% ) and K , P and Sr were identified as minor components . When calcined eggshell was applied in the treatment of synthetic wastewater containing heavy metals , a complete removal of Cd as well as above 99% removal of Cr was observed after 10 min . Although the natural eggshell had some removal capacity of Cd and Cr , a complete removal was not accomplished even after 60 min due to quite slower removal rate . However , in contrast to Cd and Cr , an efficient removal of Pb was observed with the natural eggshell rather than the calcined eggshell . From the application of the calcined eggshell in the treatment of real electroplating wastewater , the calcined eggshell showed a promising removal capacity of heavy metal ions as well as had a good neutralization capacity in the treatment of strong acidic wastewater .

Herein , we developed a label-free electrochemical sensor for CD44 by ligand-protein interaction . We assembled carbon nanotube composites on the electrode to enhance electronic conductivity by 6 . 2-fold and reduce overpotential with a shift of 77 mV . We conjugated hyaluronic acid ( HA ) to the surface of carbon nanotubes via electrostatic interaction between HA and poly ( diallyldimethylammonium chloride ) ( PDDA ) . Consequently , we performed direct electrochemical sensing of CD44 with a dynamic range of 0 . 01-100 ng/mL and detection limit of 5 . 94 pg/mL without any postlabeling for amplification , comparable to the best current results .

__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , Syrian durum wheat landraces from diverse collection sites were evaluated for agronomic performance under arid conditions over two seasons at four locations , at two levels of nutrient availability . Grain yield differed considerably among locations . Within locations , significant population and fertilizer effects were demonstrated . In most cases , maximum yield was achieved by landraces , which demonstrates the breeding value of local germplasm . In a particular environment , the population effect was nonsignificant for total dry matter production , but significant for straw and grain yield . Nitrogen application was ineffective if moisture availability was the dominant growth limiting factor . Correlations between plant characteristics at evaluation and collection site characteristics were limited , and therefore , their utilization in germplasm evaluation appear limited . The negative relation between grain yield and soil nitrogen content at the collection site may be caused by the comparative disadvantage that germplasm from regions with favourable growing conditions has under low-yielding conditions . Particular environmental conditions at the collection site were no indicator for the response to changed growing conditions . Relatively high grain yields under good and adverse growing conditions excluded each other in all but two cases . Also , it was difficult to relate grain yield to regions of collection , as the response of individual landraces from a certain region to changing growing conditions differed strongly . Differentiation on the basis of landrace groups appears more promising . The Hauran landrace group provided the largest number of populations with relatively high grain yields over diverse environments . Durum wheat landraces from Syria

Throughout this paper , we reveal that the size of a fetch group is highly involved for hiding various types of operation stalls short latency stalls , long latency stalls , and Load/Store Unit ( LSU ) stalls . The scheduler with a small fetch group cannot hide short latency stalls due to the limited number of warps in a fetch group . In contrast , the scheduler with a large fetch group cannot hide long latency and LSU stalls due to the limited number of fetch groups and the lack of memory subsystems , respectively . To hide various types of stalls , this paper proposes a Dynamic Resizing on Active Warps ( DRAW ) scheduler which adjusts the size of a fetch group dynamically based on the execution phases of applications . For the applications that have the best performance at LRR ( one fetch group ) , the DRAW scheduler matches the performance of LRR and outperforms TL ( multiple fetch groups ) by 22 . 7 percent . In addition , for the applications that have the best performance at TL , our scheduler achieves 11 . 0 and 5 . 5 percent better performance compared to LRR and TL , respectively .

__label__sciMet_Biomedical_Engineering , Polymeric stents can be considered as an alternative to metallic stents thanks to their lessened incidence of restenosis and controlled deployment . The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of developing a temperature-responsive braided stent using shape memory polyurethane ( SMPU ) through finite element analysis . It was assumed that braided stents were manufactured using SMPU fibers . The mechanical behavior of SMPU fibers was modeled using a constitutive equation describing their one-dimensional thermal-induced shape memory behavior . Then , the braided stents were analyzed to investigate their mechanical behavior using finite element analysis software , in which the constitutive equation was implemented through a user material subroutine . The diameter of the SMPU fibers and braiding angle were chosen as the design parameters and their values were adjusted to ensure that the mechanical properties of the braided polymer stents match those of metallic stents . Finally , the deployment process of the braided stents inside narrowed vessels was simulated , showing that the SMPU stents can be comfortably implanted while minimizing the overpressure onto the vessel walls , due to their thermo-responsive shape memory behavior . Simulation of mechanical behavior of temperature-responsive braided stents made of shape memory polyurethanes . 
__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , Abstract The genetic control of the synthesis of stearic acid ( C18 0 ) and oleic acid ( C18 1 ) in the seed oil of sunflower was studied through candidate-gene and QTL analysis . Two F2 mapping populations were developed using the high C18 0 mutant CAS-3 crossed to either HA-89 ( standard , high linoleic fatty acid profile ) , or HAOL-9 ( high C18 1 version of HA-89 ) . A stearoyl-ACP desaturase locus ( SAD17A ) , and an oleoyl-PC de-saturase locus ( OLD7 ) were found to cosegregate with the previously described Es1 and Ol genes controlling the high C18 0 and the high C18 1 traits , respectively . Using linkage maps constructed from AFLP and RFLP markers , these loci mapped to LG1 ( SAD17A ) and to LG14 ( OLD7 ) and were found to underlie the major QTLs affecting the concentrations of C18 0 and C18 1 , explaining around 80% and 56% of the phenotypic variance of these fatty acids , respectively . These QTLs pleiotropically affected the levels of other primary fatty acids in the seed storage lipids . A minor QTL affecting both C18 0 and C18 1 levels was identified on LG8 in the HAOL-9×CAS-3 F2 . This QTL showed a significant epistatic interaction for C18 1 with the QTL at the OLD7 locus , and was hypothesized to be a modifier of Ol . Two additional minor C18 0 QTLs were also detected on LG7 and LG3 in the HA-89×CAS-3 and the HAOL-9×CAS-3 F2 populations , respectively . No association between a mapped FatB thioesterase locus and fatty acid concentration was found . These results provide strong support about the role of fatty acid desaturase genes in determining fatty acid composition in the seed oil of sunflower . Stearoyl-ACP and oleoyl-PC desaturase genes cosegregate with quantitative trait loci underlying high stearic and high oleic acid mutant phenotypes in sunflower
__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , SummaryThe genetics of nitrate content in butterhead lettuce ( Lactuca sativa L . ) was studied using the mean values of five parental genotypes and several generations obtained from crosses between them . One high nitrate parental genotype was chosen and four low nitrate ones . A diallel analysis showed additive genetic effects to be the major source of variation in generation means . Estimates of additive genetic effects differed significantly between experiments , indicating genotype x experiment interactions . Effects of dominance were relatively small . The size and direction of dominance varied between experiments . Reciprocal differences were of very limited size and also varied between experiments . The inheritance of nitrate content in lettuce fitted the additive-dominance genetic model . Genetics of nitrate content of lettuce , 1 Analysis of generation means
__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , Conventional Fourier transform infrared ( FT-IR ) spectroscopy and microscopy have been widely used in forensic science . New opportunities exist to obtain chemical images and to enhance the spatial resolution using attenuated total reflection ( ATR ) FT-IR spectroscopy coupled with a focal-plane array ( FPA ) detector . In this paper , the sensitivity limits of FT-IR imaging using three different ATR crystals ( Ge , ZnSe , and diamond ) in three different optical arrangements for the detection of model particles is discussed . Model systems of ibuprofen and paracetamol particles having sizes below 32 μm were studied . The collection of drug particles was achieved with the aid of two different tapes common adhesive tape and a film of polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) . The surface of the film with collected particles was measured directly via ATR-FT-IR imaging . Since the removal of tape from porous surfaces can be difficult , the application of micro ATR-FT-IR imaging directly to the surface of a newspaper contaminated with particles of model drugs is also discussed . In order to assess the feasibility of the chosen method in a forensic case study , the detection of diacetylmorphine hydrochloride traces in PDMS matrix and the finger surface is investigated . The scenarios considered were that of the detection of evidence collected at a crime scene with the tape lift method and the analysis of the finger of an individual after drug handling . The results show broad implications in the detection of drugs of abuse . Combining the Tape-Lift Method and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopic Imaging for Forensic Applications
__label__sciMet_Applied_Physics , The wetting balance test was performed in an attempt to estimate the fluxless wetting properties of under bump metallurgy ( UBM ) -coated Si-wafer and top surface metallurgy ( TSM ) -coated glass substrate to SnPb solder . The wetting curves of the single-and double-side-coated UBM had a similar shape and the parameters characterizing the curve shape showed a similar tendency as a function of temperature . Wetting property estimation was possible with the new wettability indices from the wetting curves of one side-coated specimens Fmin , Fs , and ts . Au/Cu/Cr UBM was better than Au/Ni/Ti UBM from the point of wetting time . For TSM , it was more effective to use Cu as a wetting layer with Au as a protection layer than to use Au as a wetting layer alone . The contact angle of one-side-coated Si-plate to SnPb solder can be calculated from the force balance equation by measuring static state force and tilt angle . The contact angles of Au/Cu/Cr and Au/Ni/Ti UBM of Si-wafer to SnPb solder were 59 . 9° and 63 . 9° , respectively . The contact angles of Au/Cu/Cr and Au/Cr TSM of glass to SnPb were 78 . 9 and 76 . 1° , respectively . Fluxless wetting propeities of one-side-coated under bump metallurgy and top surface metallurgy

Duration and proceeding of these processes depend upon a previous choice of a certain number of constant parameters . There is , indeed , a theorem of Pontryagin and collaborators ( theorem 17 of [1] ) , which states the optimizing conditions for control processes with parameters , in the case when the boundaries of the time interval representing the process duration do not depend upon the parameters , and these can vary without any limits . In order to cancel these restrictions , the problem has been reconsidered in a more general shape , and a new resolving expression has been obtained . Opt imum problems with controlling parameters can be found , for instance , in the stage composition optimization of multistage missiles . Some extensions of the L . S .

__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , Plant hormone biology is an ever-evolving field and as such , novel avenues of research must always be sought . Technological and theoretical advancement can also allow for previously dismissed research to yield equally interesting insights into processes now that they are better understood . The auxin phenylacetic acid ( PAA ) is an excellent example of this . PAA is a plant auxin that also possesses substantial antimicrobial activity . It has a broad distribution and has been studied in bacteria , fungi , algae and land plants . Research on this compound in plants was prominent in the 1980s , where its bioactivity and broad distribution were frequently examined . Unfortunately , due to the strong interest in the quintessential auxin , indole-3-acetic acid ( IAA ) , research on PAA quickly petered out . Recently , several groups have resumed investigations on this hormone in plants , yet , little is known about PAA biology and its physiological role is unclear . PAA biosynthesis from the amino acid Phe invites direct comparisons with previously studied IAA biosynthesis pathways , and recent work has shown that PAA metabolism and signaling appears to be similar to that of IAA . However , given the large gap between previous work and recent investigations , a historical review of this auxin is required to renew our understanding of PAA . Here , previous work on PAA is reassessed in light of recent research in plants and serves as a synthesis of current knowledge on PAA biology . An Historical Review of Phenylacetic Acid

__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , We are demonstrating here the successful development of an ionic liquid device based on affinity ionic liquids AIL 1-6 tailored for chemoselective detection of gaseous chemical warfare agent ( CWA ) mimics on a quartz crystal microbalance ( QCM ) as well as on disposable filter papers . In the QCM platform , the negligible vapor pressure of ionic liquids ensures that AILs do not dry out on quartz chips and are used free of leakage during the measurements . This lack of vapor pressure makes these ionic liquid devices highly attractive for gas analysis . In the present study , chemoselective CWA mimic vapor detection by QCM occurs when gas rapidly diffuses into the AIL thin film and accordingly the nucleophilic substitution reaction emerges under the experimental conditions developed . Our initial results give credence to three important conclusions ( i ) AILs could be prepared in short synthetic steps and are remarkable in detecting CWA mimics , ( ii ) the analysis of gaseous CWA mimics on QCM is label-free and chemoselective , and ( iii ) the detection of CWA mimic vapor by AILs on filter paper discs is colorimetric and portable , and , once used , the paper disc can be disposed . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report in the literature based on the CWA mimic vapor detection in ionic liquids on a QCM .

__label__sciMet_Computation_Theory_&_Mathematics , Abstract In this paper we study the lift-and-project polyhedral operators defined by Lovasz and Schrijver [L . Lovasz , A . Schrijver , Cones of matrices and set-functions and 0-1 optimization , SIAM J . Optimization 1 , ( 1991 ) , pp . 166–190] and by Balas , Ceria and Cornuejols [3] on the clique relaxation of the stable set polytope of webs . We prove they have the same perfomance when starting from the clique relaxation of the family of webs W s ( k + 1 ) + k k . Considering the lift-and-project strength of facets for the stable set polytope on webs defined in [S . Bianchi , M . Escalante , M . S . Montelar , Strength of facets for the set covering and set packing polyhedra on circulant matrices , Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics 35 , ( 2009 ) , pp . 109-114] , we obtain that the facets of maximum strength for the family W s ( k + 1 ) + k k are also the facets of maximum strength according to Goemans ' measure [M . Goemans , Worst-case Comparison of Valid Inequalities for the TSP , Mathematical Programming , Fifth Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization Conference , LNCS 1084 , Vancouver , Canada , ( 1996 ) , pp . 415–429] .

__label__sciMet_Chemical_Physics , We use Brownian Dynamics ( BD ) simulations and continuum models to study the microstructures and mechanics in the colloidal film drying process . Colloidal suspensions are compressed between a planar moving interface and a stationary substrate . In the BD simulations , we develop a new Energy Minimization Potential-Free ( EMPF ) algorithm to enforce the hard-sphere potential in confined systems and to accurately measure the stress profile . The interface moves either at a constant velocity Uw or via a constant imposed normal stress Σe . Comparing the interface motions to the particle Brownian motion defines the Péclet numbers PeU = Uwa/d0 and PeΣ = Σea3/kBT , respectively , where d0 = kBT/ζ with kBT the thermal energy scale , ζ the single-particle resistance , and a the particle radius . With a constant interface velocity , thermodynamics drives the suspension behavior when PeU ≪ 1 , and homogeneous crystallization appears when the gap spacing between the two boundaries pushes the volume fraction above the equilibrium phase boundary . In contrast , when PeU ≫ 1 , local epitaxial crystal growth appears adjacent to the moving interface even for large gap sizes . Interestingly , the most amorphous film microstructures are found at moderate PeU . The film stress profile develops sharp transitions and becomes step-like with growing Péclet number . With a constant imposed stress , the interface stops moving as the suspension pressure increases and the microstructural and mechanical behaviors are similar to the constant velocity case . Comparison with the simulations shows that the model accurately captures the stress on the moving interface , and quantitatively resolves the local stress and volume fraction distributions for low to moderate Péclet numbers . This work demonstrates the critical role of interface motion on the film microstructures and stresses . Microstructures and mechanics in the colloidal film drying process . 
__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , Fast , reliable and inexpensive analytical techniques for trace detection of explosive components are in high demand . Our approach is to develop specific sensor coating materials based on molecularly imprinted polymers ( MIPs ) . Despite the known inhibition of radical polymerisations by nitro groups and the known shrinkage of the polymer lattice during/after drying we were able to synthesize particulate MIPs by suspension polymerisation as well as thin MIP coatings by direct surface polymerisation on quartz crystal microbalances ( QCM ) . The best method to purify the porous beads was Soxhlet extraction followed by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction ( SFE with sc-CO2 ) at mild conditions ( 150 bar , 50 degrees C ) . At least a removal of >99 . 7% of the template was achieved . Performance tests of TNT imprinted polymer beads showed that acrylamide ( AA ) and more pronounced also methacrylic acid ( MAA ) possessed an enhanced adsorption tendency for gaseous TNT . An adsorption of 2 , 4-DNT , dinitrotoluene , by these MIPs was not detected . Using 2 , 4-DNT as template and methacrylamide , MAAM , a positive imprint effect for gaseous 2 , 4-DNT was achieved with no measurable cross-sensitivity for 2 , 4 , 6-TNT . The thin MIP coatings directly synthesized on the QCMs showed thicknesses of 20 to up to 500 nm . Preliminary screening experiments were performed for five different monomers and three different solvents ( acetonitrile , chloroform and dimethylformamide ) . Best adsorption properties for TNT vapour until now showed a PAA-MIP synthesized with chloroform . Direct measurements of the mass attachment , respectively frequency decrease of the coated QCMs during vapour treatment showed a TNT-uptake of about 150 pg per microg MIP per hour . Results look worthy for further studies . Gas phase detection of explosives such as 2 , 4 , 6-trinitrotoluene by molecularly imprinted polymers . 
__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , Picloram is a widely used chlorinated herbicide , which is quite persistent and mobile in soil and water with adverse health and environmental risks . A simple and efficient method with high sensitivity and good selectivity was developed in this work to analyze picloram . The aldehyde group functionalized quartz glass plate was used to catch picloram by Schiff base reaction , and reacted with the liposomes-labeled antibody . The fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) solution was encapsulated in the liposomes . After being released from the liposomes , the fluorescence of FITC was measured by a fluorimeter . It was found that the fluorescence intensity is linearly correlated to the logarithm of picloram concentration , ranging from 1 . 0 × 10 ( -4 ) to 100 ng mL ( -1 ) , with a detection limit of 1 . 0 × 10 ( -5 ) ng mL ( -1 ) . Picloram concentration in real wastewater samples were accurately measured by the proposed method and HPLC , the results of the two methods were approximately the same . The proposed method showed high sensitivity and good selectivity , and could be an efficient tool for picloram quantitative analysis .

__label__sciMet_Evolutionary_Biology , The internal cranial morphology of the bone-cracking hyena Pliocrocuta perrieri ( Carnivora , Hyaenidae ) is described based on three crania from the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene of the Iberian Peninsula . The shape and size of the inner cranial cavities ( with emphasis on encephalization and relative regional brain volumes ) are compared with those of extant hyaenids with the aid of computed tomography techniques—which had not been previously used to study the brain morphology of any extinct bone-cracking hyena . Our results indicate that the frontal sinuses of P . perrieri are caudally extended and overlap the brain cavity , as in other extinct and extant bone-cracking hyaenids . In turn , the brain morphology and sulcal pattern of P . perrieri are more similar to those of Hyaena hyaena and Parahyaena brunnea than to those of Crocuta crocuta among extant bone-cracking hyaenids . Our results further indicate that Pliocrocuta is clearly less encephalized than the highly-social Crocuta , and displays an anterior cerebrum relatively smaller than in all extant bone-cracking hyenas ( indicating the possession of a poorly-developed frontal cortex ) . These facts might suggest that P . perrieri possessed less developed cognitive abilities than Crocuta for processing the information associated with complex social behaviors .

__label__sciMet_Chemical_Engineering , Abstract Knowledge of the viscosity of binary mixtures is of great importance in many industrial processes . Rarely can the viscosity of mixtures be obtained from the sum of the viscosities of the pure components . The theoretical study of the viscosity of mixtures is generally complicated . Numerous empirical correlation models have been proposed . The present study proposes a new empirical correlation equation , based on lineal behavior . The equation can easily be used with one , two or three parameters , and in many cases it improves upon the models that are commonly used . Likewise , the excess viscosity calculated with the proposed equation generally yield more satisfactory results than those obtained with the polynomial equation of Redlich-Kister .

__label__sciMet_General_Physics , Mobile impurities in a Bose-Einstein condensate form quasiparticles called polarons . Here , we show that two such polarons can bind to form a bound bipolaron state . Its emergence is caused by an induced nonlocal interaction mediated by density oscillations in the condensate , and we derive using field theory an effective Schrödinger equation describing this for an arbitrarily strong impurity-boson interaction . We furthermore compare with quantum Monte Carlo simulations finding remarkable agreement , which underlines the predictive power of the developed theory . It is found that bipolaron formation typically requires strong impurity interactions beyond the validity of more commonly used weak-coupling approaches that lead to local Yukawa-type interactions . We predict that the bipolarons are observable in present experiments , and we describe a procedure to probe their properties . Bipolarons in a Bose-Einstein Condensate . 
__label__sciMet_Mechanical_Engineering_&_Transports , Using a focal plane array infrared camera , the heat generated during large strain compression ( at a rate of 1 s−1 ) is used to study the characteristics of plastic flow for hcp zirconium . Heat generation during plastic flow in a reference material , copper , was seen to develop uniformly both at the lower ( 40 μm/pixel ) and higher ( 8 μm/pixel ) magnifications used in this study . The thermomechanical response of Zr , however , was seen to depend on the loading direction with respect to the specimen texture . Highly textured zirconium compressed along nonbasal oriented grains results in a homogeneous thermal response at both scales . However , compression along basal ( 0001 ) oriented grains shows evidence of inhomogeneous deformation at small strains that lead to macroscale localization and failure at large strains . The conversion of plastic work into heat is observed to be a dynamic process , both in the time-dependent nature of the energy conversion , but also in the passage of waves and ‘bursts’ of plastic heating . Basal compression also showed evidence of small scale localization at strains far below macroscale localization , even below 10% . These localizations at the lower strain levels eventually dominate the response , and form the shear band that is responsible for the softening of the macroscopic stress–strain curve .

__label__sciMet_Optics , We applied nonlinear optimization to design nanophotonics-based metamaterials for efficient free-space-to-waveguide coupling . Three devices were designed , fabricated and characterized . The first device couples incident light into a multi-mode waveguide , the second device couples incident light into a single-mode waveguide directly , and the third device couples and separates two orthogonal polarizations into two multi-mode waveguides . All devices offer comparable or higher coupling efficiencies , are easier to fabricate , and demonstrate higher bandwidth when compared to conventional devices . Furthermore , each device is at least an order of magnitude smaller in area than previously reported devices . The highly efficient single-mode waveguide-coupler is a unique device that has not been experimentally demonstrated before . We further performed careful simulations to underscore the tolerance of these devices to fabrication errors . Their robustness is primarily a result of the large number of coupled guided-mode resonances that are responsible for each device performance .

__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , Fungal species in the family Botryosphaeriaceae have been recently recognized as the most common fungi isolated from grapevine ( Vitis vinifera ) cankers in California . However , the role of these fungi in causing grapevine dieback as well as their status as canker-causing agents was unknown . Therefore , pathogenicity studies were conducted to determine their importance as grapevine pathogens in California . A total of 72 isolates representing all nine Botryosphaeriaceae species isolated from grapevine cankers from California were used in five different pathogenicity studies . Overall , experiments showed all nine Botryosphaeriaceae species able to infect both young and mature tissues as well as green shoots of the new vegetative growth causing cankers , vascular discoloration , and/or otherwise dark streaking of the wood . However , virulence varied among species . Lasiodiplodia theobromae was the most virulent species followed by Neofusicoccum luteum , N . parvum , and N . australe , all categorized as highly virulent . Botryosphaeria dothidea was considered intermediately virulent and Diplodia mutila , D . seriata , Dothiorella iberica , and D . viticola were shown to be weakly virulent . This study shows species of Botryosphaeriaceae to be much more important pathogens on grapevines than originally thought , and some of them , in view of their virulence , should be considered high risk for causing severe and rapid canker and dieback diseases in the grapevine industry in California .

__label__sciMet_Computer_Hardware_&_Architecture , __label__KEYWORDS_CMOS_process , This paper presents a robust energy/area-efficient receiver fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process . The receiver consists of eight data lanes plus one forwarded-clock lane supporting the hypertransport standard for high-density chip-to-chip links . The proposed all-digital clock and data recovery ( ADCDR ) circuit , which is well suited for today ' s CMOS process scaling , enables the receiver to achieve low power and area consumption . The ADCDR can enter into open loop after lock-in to save power and avoid clock dithering phenomenon . Moreover , to compensate the open loop , a phase tracking procedure is proposed to enable the ADCDR to track the phase drift due to the voltage and temperature variations . Furthermore , the all-digital delay-locked loop circuit integrated in the ADCDR can generate accurate multiphase clocks with the proposed calibrated locking algorithm in the presence of process variations . The precise multiphase clocks are essential for the half-rate sampling and Alexander-type phase detecting . Measurement results show that the receiver can operate at a data rate of 6 . 4 Gbits/s with a bit error rate < 10-12 , consuming 7 . 5-mW per lane ( 1 . 2 pJ/bit ) under a 0 . 85 V power supply . With ADCDR ' s phase tracking , the receiver performs better in jitter tolerance and achieves a 500-kHz bandwidth , which is high enough to track the phase drift . The receiver core occupies an area of 0 . 02 mm2 per lane .

__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , BackgroundCultivated peanut or groundnut ( Arachis hypogaea L . ) is the fourth most important oilseed crop in the world , grown mainly in tropical , subtropical and warm temperate climates . Due to its origin through a single and recent polyploidization event , followed by successive selection during breeding efforts , cultivated groundnut has a limited genetic background . In such species , microsatellite or simple sequence repeat ( SSR ) markers are very informative and useful for breeding applications . The low level of polymorphism in cultivated germplasm , however , warrants a need of larger number of polymorphic microsatellite markers for cultivated groundnut . ResultsA microsatellite-enriched library was constructed from the genotype TMV2 . Sequencing of 720 putative SSR-positive clones from a total of 3 , 072 provided 490 SSRs . 71 . 2% of these SSRs were perfect type , 13 . 1% were imperfect and 15 . 7% were compound . Among these SSRs , the GT/CA repeat motifs were the most common ( 37 . 6% ) followed by GA/CT repeat motifs ( 25 . 9% ) . The primer pairs could be designed for a total of 170 SSRs and were optimized initially on two genotypes . 104 ( 61 . 2% ) primer pairs yielded scorable amplicon and 46 ( 44 . 2% ) primers showed polymorphism among 32 cultivated groundnut genotypes . The polymorphic SSR markers detected 2 to 5 alleles with an average of 2 . 44 per locus . The polymorphic information content ( PIC ) value for these markers varied from 0 . 12 to 0 . 75 with an average of 0 . 46 . Based on 112 alleles obtained by 46 markers , a phenogram was constructed to understand the relationships among the 32 genotypes . Majority of the genotypes representing subspecies hypogaea were grouped together in one cluster , while the genotypes belonging to subspecies fastigiata were grouped mainly under two clusters . ConclusionNewly developed set of 104 markers extends the repertoire of SSR markers for cultivated groundnut . These markers showed a good level of PIC value in cultivated germplasm and therefore would be very useful for germplasm analysis , linkage mapping , diversity studies and phylogenetic relationships in cultivated groundnut as well as related Arachis species .

__label__sciMet_Polymers , The aim of this study is to investigate natural cellulosic fibers extracted from Tridax procumbens plants . The obtained fibers were alkali treated for their effective usage as reinforcement in composites . The physical , chemical , crystallinity , thermal , wettability and surface characteristics were analyzed for raw , and alkali treated Tridax procumbens fibers ( TPFs ) . The test results conclude that there was an increase in cellulose content with a reduction in hemicellulose , lignin , and wax upon alkali treatment . This enhanced the thermal stability , tensile strength , crystallinity , and surface roughness characteristics . The contact angle was also lesser for treated TPFs which prove its better wettability with the liquid phase . The Weibull distribution analysis was adopted for the analysis of the fiber diameter and tensile properties . Thus the considerable improvement in the properties of alkali treated TPFs would be worth for developing high-performance polymer composites . Characterization of raw and alkali treated new natural cellulosic fibers from Tridax procumbens .

__label__sciMet_Geological_&_Geomatics_Engineering , Assuming the shear modulus of nonhomogeneous soil increased linearly with depth , taking into account the characteristics of torsional vibration , the dynamic motion equations of a nonhomogeneous saturated soil were established . By using Hankel integral transform , the tangential displacement and shear stresses in Hankel transform domain were formulated . The upper surface of the nonhomogeneous saturated stratum underlain by bedrock was free , and there was no shear stress in the upper surface . The lower surface of the stratum was fully bonded to bedrock , and the displacement in the lower surface was zero . In the plane where the foundation was embedded , mixed boundary conditions were considered . Thus , the dual integral equations of a rigid disc embedded in a nonhomogeneous saturated stratum were established . By appropriate transform , the dual integral equations were converted to a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind , which could be solved by numerical method , thus the torsional dynamic response problem was solved . Comparing with the relation between a static torque and angular displacement , the dynamic compliance coefficient and the torsional angular amplitude were given . The problem was reduced to a simplify case and compared with previous research results . Selected numerical studies indicate that both the embedment depth of the foundation and the degree of soil’s nonhomogeneity have an influence on the dynamic compliance coefficient , the torsional angular amplitude and the resultant contact shear stress .

__label__sciMet_Applied_Physics , The possibility of amplification of terahertz-range electromagnetic waves due to optical transitions between a two-dimensional continuum and shallow-level donor states in GaAs/AlGaAs superlattices with selectively δ-doped quantum wells is analyzed theoretically . The population inversion required for the gain is attained under the conditions of vertical transport in the superlattice due to the hybridization of states in neighboring quantum wells coupled via electron tunneling through the barrier . It is shown that , at a doping level of 5 × 1010 cm−2 per period , the gain can be as high as 50 cm−1 at wavelengths 100–120 μm . The current density under operating conditions is ∼50 A/cm2 .

This is done primarily to remove concerns that the original scaling laws contain featuresspecific to the Vancouver data upon which they were based . This new analysis also employs the integrated , ratherthan instantaneous , heat flux proposed by Tijm . The analysis results in well-defined scaling laws for allthree locations , and include explicit latitude dependence , which was not possible in the earlier study . The integratedheat flux reveals systematic diurnal behaviour that is shown to result in a separate scaling law for diurnalevolution of sea breezes at a single location .

__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , The main components of organic micro pollution regularly found in the river Elbe , belong to the wide spectrum of pesticides , nitro and chloro benzenes and the chelating agents , especially ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) . The level of organic micro pollution with pesticides and the other organic micro pollutants in the upper and middle reaches of the river Elbe between Schmilka and Wittenberge was determined over a period of nearly three years . Four sample preparation methods ( SPE solidphase extraction and LLE liquid-liquid extraction both with and without derivatization ) have been used to analyze a wide spectrum of pesticides with different polarities by GC/ECD , NPD and MS . The pesticide pollution caused by the triazines decreases significantly from 0 . 35 μg/l ( mean value ) in 1992 up to 0 . 15 μg/l ( mean value ) in 1994 . The correlation with the river water flow shows the diffuse character of the triazine input . In the last year of the pesticide screening a change to the more polar substances such as phenoxyalkanoic acid and nitrophenol pesticides as well as chloralkanoic acid pesticides have been noticed . The origin of trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) can be explained by the waste influence , supported by the good correlation of the TCA course with the chloroform concentrations determined .

Samples of urine and faeces were collected and analysed after 123 days of storage in plastic cans ( urine ) and 8 months of storage in closed composting bags ( faeces ) . Selected physicochemical parameters ( ammonium , phosphorus , potassium , calcium , magnesium ) and pathogens ( bacteria and helminths eggs ) were monitored . Results showed that temperature and pH values were 26 . 0°C and 7 . 2 , and 27 . 6°C and 8 . 6 for the faeces and urine , respectively . The physicochemical analysis revealed high nutrient contents and low trace metal levels in the faeces-based compost . Concentrations of magnesium , cadmium , copper , lead and zinc ranged from 0 . 46 to 54 . 98 mg/kg while those of phosphorus , potassium and calcium were >700 mg/kg on average . In urine , the concentrations of phosphorus , potassium , calcium , copper and zinc were 930 , 1240 , 1402 . 8 , 0 . 0672 and 0 . 121 mg/L , respectively . Various bacteria ( including total coliforms , faecal coliforms , faecal streptococci and anaerobic sulphite reducers ) , along with Ascaris lombricoïds ( 1 . 66 eggs/g ) , were found in the faeces-based compost .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , X-ray absorption near-edge structure ( XANES ) at sulfur K-edge was used to determine the sulfate species present in size-fractionated aerosol particles based on the postedge structure after the main absorption peak in the XANES region . A comparison of the XANES spectra of reference sulfate materials and aerosol samples collected in Tsukuba in Japan clearly showed that ( NH4 ) 2SO4 was the main sulfur species in particles with a smaller diameter and CaSO4 x 2H2O ( gypsum ) was the main sulfur species in particles with a larger diameter . A simulation of the XANES spectra by reference materials allows us to obtain the quantitative mixing ratios of the different sulfate species present in the aerosol samples . The presence of minor sulfur species other than ( NH4 ) 2SO4 and gypsum at the surface of mineral aerosols is suggested in our simulations and by a surface-sensitive conversion electron/He-ion yield XANES . In the absence of a contribution from a large dust event , the mole concentration of gypsum in the mineral aerosol fraction ( particle diameter > 1 microm ) determined by XANES is similar to that of Ca which is determined independently using ion chromatography . This shows that the Ca and sulfate in the mineral aerosols are present only as gypsum . Considering that calcite is the main Ca mineral in the original material arising from an arid and semiarid area in China , it is strongly suggested that gypsum is formed in aerosol during its long-range transportation by a reaction between calcite and sulfate ions . Speciation of sulfate in size-fractionated aerosol particles using sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure .

We propose an intensity-modulated surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) sensor based on a four-layer Kretschmann structural model . To achieve high-sensitivity intensity detection for the measured sample , a silver/gold ( Ag/Au ) composite film structure is proposed and optimized by a numerical simulation method , and then the chitosan thin film modified by glutaraldehyde cross-linked as an active layer for adsorbing measured sample is applied and immobilized onto the surface of the Ag/Au composite film by spin-coating technique . In addition , a reference beam is introduced into the system to raise its resolution and stability .

__label__sciMet_Computation_Theory_&_Mathematics , Abstract . We revisit the notion of kinetic efficiency for noncanonically defined discrete attributes of moving data , like binary space partitions and triangulations . Under reasonable computational models , we obtain lower bounds on the minimum amount of work required to maintain any binary space partition of moving segments in the plane or any Steiner triangulation of moving points in the plane . Such lower bounds—the first to be obtained in the kinetic context—are necessary to evaluate the efficiency of kinetic data structures when the attribute to be maintained is not canonically defined .

Refractive index changes greater than 10-3 were measured in Bragg grating reflectors recorded in a low-Ge content fiber , using average intensities of approximately 0 . 35GW/cm2 . Grating growth curves for 213nm inscription wavelength are presented and discussed , in comparison with data obtained using 248nm excimer laser radiation . The experimental results presented denote that contrary to the recording using longer laser wavelengths and pulse durations , the grating inscription employing 213nm picosecond radiation is dominated by a two-photon absorption , which role becomes prominent in long-exposures .

Basis set-extrapolated coupled cluster singles , doubles , and perturbative triples [CCSD ( T ) ] calculations serve as a reference for this study . Compared to standard exchange-correlation functionals , tuned long-range corrected hybrid functionals produce highly reliable results for vertical IPs and EAs , yielding mean absolute errors on par with computationally more demanding GW calculations .

__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , The expression of genes encoding conglutin γ and a leginsulin-like protein has been examined in narrow-leafed lupin , Lupinus angustifolius L . Conglutin γ is a homologue of basic 7S globulin ( Bg ) , the insulin and leginsulin binding protein from soybean . Accumulation of conglutin γ mRNA , as assessed by northern assays and reverse-transcription PCR , was tightly regulated both spatially and temporally in lupin plants and was detected almost exclusively in developing seeds . Similar tissue and temporal specificity was demonstrated when 1 . 8 kb of the promoter region from the conglutin γ gene was used to drive the expression of a β-glucuronidase reporter gene in transgenic plants . In stably transformed tobacco the conglutin γ promoter produced strong , temporally regulated and seed-specific expression of the reporter gene which was localised to the embryo tissues and to a layer of cells adjacent to the seed coat . A truncated 0 . 29 kb promoter fragment produced much reduced levels of expression and a loss of embryo specificity . Leginsulin-like mRNA was similarly detected in lupins only in developing seeds . The leginsulin-like gene detected in L . angustifolius showed 96% sequence identity to leginsulin from soybean within the 280 bp region amplified from lupin by PCR . The results demonstrate that both components of a Bg-leginsulin putative signal transduction pathway are present in the seeds of lupin .

__label__sciMet_Oceanography , A wave-height meter using a simple microwave Doppler radar , \simeq10mW in power and 10 . 525 GHz in frequency , is proposed so that we can measure oceanic waves effectively while the ship is steaming . It was first applied to the measurement of the variation of water level generated in a wave tank , which suggested that it is adequately applicable to the measurement of oceanic waves . A field test was carried out off the cape of Nojimazaki by installing the Doppler radar 5 m above the sea level at the bow of the ship . The result agreed reasonably well with that measured simultaneously by the ultrasonic wave-height meter installed at the same position . Another test is running successfully on a larger ship with the wave-height meter installed at 9 m above the sea level .

__label__sciMet_Industrial_Engineering_&_Automation , Multiaxis machining ( e . g . , milling ) of large aerospace structures is typically carried out using large monument scale expensive computer numerical control ( CNC ) machine tools . In contrast , multiple degree-of-freedom-articulated robotic arm-based machining has several potential advantages over CNC machine tools , owing to its flexibility ( reconfigurability ) and lower cost . However , its application is limited by its much lower stiffness and accuracy compared with a CNC machine tool . This paper presents a new method that combines wireless force sensing with a mechanistic model of the milling process to increase the accuracy of robotic milling while preserving its flexibility . Articulated-arm robotic milling experiments are conducted to validate the concept . Experimental results show significant improvement ( > 70% ) in the dimensional accuracy of simple geometric features machined using the new method .

__label__sciMet_Geochemistry_&_Geophysics , Location-based services ( LBS ) have emerged from the combination of recent technological advances in wireless communication , mobile computing , and positioning systems . As might be expected for this relatively new area of study , the topic of location-based services remains rather ill-defined and nebulous . This book aims to consolidate the fundamentals of LBS and to provide a complete introduction to LBS for students , academics , and industry professionals . The book is an edited collection of chapters by different authors , and includes contributions from wellknown academics in the fields of geographic information science , computer science , and engineering . The structure of the book is clear and logical , with three distinct sections progressing from fundamentals in part one , through integrated systems in part two , to applications of LBS in part three . Part one contains chapters on remote sensing ( Chapter 2 ) , positioning ( Chapter 3 ) , and wireless communications ( Chapter 4 ) . All three of these chapters are authoritative and provide good coverage of their respective topics . In general these chapters are well written , although often technical to an extent that may discourage student readers of the book . Most of this early material is not specific to LBS , and so can also be found in the standard texts on on remote sensing , positioning , and wireless communications . Thus , the chapters constitute a useful reference , but readers who are comfortable with these topics can safely skip forward to part two . An introductory chapter in part one ( Chapter 1 ) seemed to have been written as an afterthought and did not contribute much to the book . As an example , Chapter 1 includes about six pages of technical specifications for well-known GIS software packages ( e . g . , disk space , memory , and operating system requirements ) , which one might more easily find by browsing the Web . Part two begins with an overview of the architecture of LBS ( Chapter 5 ) , focusing primarily on client-server architectures , but ending with a brief look at mobile ad hoc networks .

The oxidation is performed in alkaline medium until +1 . 4 V ( Ag/AgCl ) at graphite electrodes .

__label__sciMet_Artificial_Intelligence_&_Image_Processing , Video encoders and decoders for HEVC-like compression standards require huge external memory bandwidth , which occupies a significant portion of the codec power consumption . To reduce the memory bandwidth , this paper presents a new lossless reference frame recompression algorithm along with a high-throughput hardware architecture . Firstly , hybrid spatial -domain prediction is proposed to combine the merits of DPCM scanning and averaging . The prediction is then enhanced with multiple modes to accommodate various image characteristics . Finally , efficient residual regrouping based on semi-fixed-length ( SFL ) coding is used to improve the compression performance . Compared to no compression , the proposed scheme can reduce data traffic by an average of 57 . 6% with no image quality degradation . The average compression ratio is 2 . 49 , an improvement of at least 12 . 2-13 . 2% , relative to the state-of-the-art algorithms . By applying a reordered two-step architecture and the two optimizations , residual reuse and simplified coding mode decision , the hardware cost is similar to that of previous reference frame recompression architectures . The computational complexity increase caused by multi-mode prediction affects the HW cost slightly . This work can be implemented with 45 . 1 k gates for the compressor and 34 . 5 k gates for the decompressor at 300 MHz , enough to support a 3840 ×2160@60fps video encoder and decoder .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , Over-exploration of rare earth elements causes soil desertification and environmental degradation . However , the restoration of rare earth mine tailings requires the recovery of both vegetation and soil microbiota . Accordingly , the present study aimed to compare the efficacy of restoring mine tailings using organic compost and native plants ( Miscanthus sinensis , Pinus massoniana , Bambusa textilis , or a mixture of all three ) . After three years , the mixed plantation harbored tenfold greater plant richness than that in the barren land . Among these , M . sinensis played a dominant role across all restored areas . The microbial communities of the soils were assessed using high-throughput 16S rDNA gene sequencing . A total of 34 , 870 16S rDNA gene sequences were obtained and classified into 15 bacterial phyla and 36 genera . The dominant genus across all the restored soils was Burkholderia , and the bacterial diversity of restored soils was greater than that of soils from either unrestored or natural ( unexploited ) areas , with the M . sinensis plantation yielding the greatest diversity . The effects of phytoremediation were mainly driven by changes in nutrient and metal contents . These results indicate that M . sinensis significantly improves phytoremediation and that mixed planting is ideal for restoring the soils of abandoned rare earth mines .

__label__sciMet_Nuclear_&_Particles_Physics , This paper deals with the gravi-quantum mechanical interaction on the level of the first quantisation and in the framework of a metric theory of gravitation ( no field quantisation ) . The interaction is introduced by embedding the quantum mechanics of the otherwise unaffected ( i . e . ‘free’ ) spin-1/2 particle in the given curved space-time of the 3-flat expanding Robertson-Walker universe . The metric acts thereby as an external field . The corresponding Hilbert space formalism is established in interpreting the generally covariant theory of the Dirac field in the Riemann space in question as the Dirac representation of the spin-1/2 particle in the Schrödinger picture . The evolution operator is then extracted out of the general relativistic Dirac equation , while contractions of the symmetric energy momentum tensor with the tetrad vectors of the reference system lead to the operators of energy , linear momentum and total angular momentum . The temporal behaviour of the corresponding expectation values is calculated . Quantum mechanics of ‘free’ spin-1/2 particles in an expanding universe

When being automated , this approach can simplify surveillance tasks required in , for example , airports or other security sensitive infrastructures . This paper describes a novel architecture for surveillance networks based on combining multimodal sensor information . Compared to previous methodologies using only video information , the proposed approach also uses audio data thus increasing its ability to obtain valuable information about the sensed environment . A hierarchical processing architecture for observation and surveillance systems is proposed , which recognizes a set of predefined behaviors and learns about normal behaviors . Deviations from “normality” are reported in a way understandable even for staff without special training . The processing architecture , including the physical sensor nodes , is called smart embedded network of sensing entities ( SENSE ) .

__label__sciMet_Meteorology_&_Atmospheric_Sciences , Abstract In this the second of a two-part study , we examine the physical mechanisms responsible for the increasing contrast of the land–sea surface air temperature ( SAT ) in summertime over the Far East , as observed in recent decades and revealed in future climate projections obtained from a series of transient warming and sensitivity experiments conducted under the umbrella of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 . On a global perspective , a strengthening of land–sea SAT contrast in the transient warming simulations of coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models is attributed to an increase in sea surface temperature ( SST ) . However , in boreal summer , the strengthened contrast over the Far East is reproduced only by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration . In response to SST increase alone , the tropospheric warming over the interior of the mid- to high-latitude continents including Eurasia are weaker than those over the surrounding oceans , leading to a weakening of the land–sea SAT contrast over the Far East . Thus , the increasing contrast and associated change in atmospheric circulation over East Asia is explained by CO2-induced continental warming . The degree of strengthening of the land–sea SAT contrast varies in different transient warming scenarios , but is reproduced through a combination of the CO2-induced positive and SST-induced negative contributions to the land–sea contrast . These results imply that changes of climate patterns over the land–ocean boundary regions are sensitive to future scenarios of CO2 concentration pathways including extreme cases .

__label__sciMet_Entomology , The half-lives ( tin1/2 ) of acetate sex pheromones andn-alkyl acetates were determined on either or both West Co . and Arthur H . Thomas Co . natural rubber septa . These septa gave equal half-lives . Thet1/2 values covered a large range e . g . , t1/2 for decyl acetate was 5 days and that for pentadecyl acetate was 1353 days . The expected linear relationship between Int1/2 versus the number of carbon atoms was found for the six acetates fromn-decyl to pentadecyl , but thet1/2 of hexadecyl acetate was only 478 days . This nonlinearity in the plot is attributed to the presence of polymer cross-links which create molecular size cages and produce an effect similar to that produced in gel permeation chromatography wherein large molecules elute faster than smaller ones . Thet1/2 of 4 monounsaturated acetates were close to thet1/2 for the corresponding saturated acetates , but this relationship may not be general . The half-life of one nonconjugated diunsaturated acetate was much less than that for the corresponding monounsaturated acetate , whereas the half-life of another nonconjugated diunsaturated acetate was similar to the half-life of the corresponding monounsaturated acetate . Thet1/2 values determined for the pheromones may be used to estimate evaporation rates , the length of time the evaporation rates will be within a given range , and , with multicomponent pheromones , the ratio of components in the vapor .

__label__sciMet_Acoustics , The present study aims to investigate apoptosis of human leukemia K562 cells induced by protoporphyrin IX ( PpIX ) -mediated sonodynamic therapy ( PpIX-SDT ) . METHODS The uptakes of intracellular PpIX in K562 cells were detected by flow cytometry . The sub-cellular localization of PpIX was imaged by confocal microscope . The cytotoxic effect of PpIX-SDT was assessed by MTT ( 3- ( 4 , 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ) -2 , 5-diphenylter-trazolium bromide tetrazolium ) assay . Apoptosis was evaluated by chromatin condensation with DAPI ( 4 ' -6-diamidino-2-phenylindole ) staining , decrease of mitochondria membrane potential ( MMP ) , re-distribution of Bax , and the expression changes of the key apoptosis-associated protein ( Caspase-3 and polypeptide poly ( ADP-robose ) polymerase ) . The possible mechanism of SDT-induced apoptosis was investigated by detecting by intracellular ROS ( reactive oxygen species ) generation and effect of ROS scavenger-NAC ( N-acetylcysteine ) on SDT induced apoptosis . The intracellular PpIX increased quickly within 2 h after PpIX administration and PpIX mainly localized in the mitochondria . Compared with PpIX alone and ultrasound alone groups , the synergistic cytotoxicity of PpIX plus ultrasound was significantly boosted . In addition , the ultrasound induced some extent of chromatin condensation and MMP loss was greatly enhanced by the presence of 2 μg/ml PpIX , where PpIX alone treatment showed no or only slight effect . Time-dependent Bax translocation , caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage were detected in SDT treatment groups . Besides , intracellular ROS production was significantly enhanced after SDT , and the general ROS scavenger NAC could obviously alleviate the SDT-caused cell viability loss , MMP loss , Bax redistribution and nuclear changes . These results indicated that PpIX-mediated sonodynamic action could induce apoptosis on K562 cells , and the intracellular ROS was involved in the PpIX-SDT induced apoptosis . Protoporphyrin IX-mediated sonodynamic action induces apoptosis of K562 cells . 
__label__sciMet_Computation_Theory_&_Mathematics , AbstractIsometric embeddings of $$\mathbb{Z}_{p^n+1}$$ into the Hamming space ( $$\mathbb{F}_{p}^{p^n} , w$$ ) have played a fundamental role in recent constructions of non-linear codes . The codes thus obtained are very good codes , but their rate is limited by the rate of the first-order generalized Reed–Muller code—hence , when n is not very small , these embeddings lead to the construction of low-rate codes . A natural question is whether there are embeddings with higher rates than the known ones . In this paper , we provide a partial answer to this question by establishing a lower bound on the order of a symmetry of ( $$\mathbb{F}_{p}^{N} , w$$ ) . Isometric embeddings of $$\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$$ in the Hamming space $$\mathbb{F}_{p}^{N}$$ and $$\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$$-linear codes

It was shown that 1 , 4-dibromobutane and 1 , 2-xylylene dibromide are the most effective alkylating agents , providing the formation of a stable five-membered ring with a positively charged sulfur atom . Such cations are readily detected by electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry . Sulfonium cations were further studied by tandem mass spectrometry using collision-induced dissociation ( CID ) .

__label__sciMet_Software_Engineering , This paper proposes a technique for dynamic slicing of UML architectural models . The presence of related information in diverse model parts ( or fragments ) makes dynamic slicing of Unified Modeling Language ( UML ) models a complex problem . We first extract all relevant information from a UML model specifying a software architecture into an intermediate representation , which we call a Model Dependency Graph ( MDG ) . For a given slicing criterion , our slicing algorithm traverses the constructed MDG to identify the relevant model parts that are directly or indirectly affected during the execution of a specified scenario . One novelty of our approach is computation of dynamic slice based on the structural and behavioral ( interactions only ) UML models as against independently processing separate UML models , and determining the implicit interdependencies among different model elements distributed across model views . We also briefly discuss a prototype tool named Archlice , which we have developed to implement our algorithm . A Dynamic Slicing Technique for UML Architectural Models

__label__sciMet_Polymers , AbstractPolymeric particles were utilized as a second component to assist polymer patterning via the breath figures ( BF ) method . Polymeric constituents lessen the incompatibility between particles and polymers , which brings new characteristics in both pattern fabrication and particle allocation . The influence of the experimental parameters for two kinds of polymeric particles on the pattern morphology of the obtained film was investigated . Different assembling characteristics of particles under different circumstances are also discussed . Polymeric particles are proven to be able to function as BF array stabilizers and assist in pattern formation . Also , polymeric particles enriching the patterned pores present unique assembling characteristics which are much different from previously reported inorganic particles . The possibilities for the functionalization of BF arrays utilizing functional microgels were also tested . These results demonstrate a study in the polymeric particle-assisted BF method , which may provide new insight into novel functional material preparation methods via self-assembly .

__label__sciMet_Optics , In diffraction-limited optical systems the number of optical components is rather high . Local changes in the refractive index of the order of 10−6 must be detected to guarantee an adequate performance of the system as a whole . Therefore , the Twyman-Perry method for the evaluation of refractive-index deviations from uniformity—further developed by Roberts and Langenbeck—has been programmed for a digital Twy-man-Green interferometer . If the glass block to be tested is slightly wedge shaped ( wedge angle ~10−3 rad ) , the measurement can be carried out without coating the glass block . With the help of four interferograms the variations of the refractive index apart from a linear slope , as well as the thickness variations of the glass block , can be measured and displayed .

__label__sciMet_Optics , A fiber-optic vector vibroscope based on orthogonal polarization cladding-to-core recoupling is demonstrated . A compact structure in which a short section of polarization-maintained ( PM ) fiber stub containing a straight fiber Bragg grating ( FBG ) is spliced to another single-mode fiber . Two well-defined orthogonally polarized cladding modes reflected by the PM-FBG are recoupled at the junction and the coupling intensity shows an extremely high sensitivity to bending in the corresponding orthogonal directions . Both the orientation and amplitude of the vibrations can be determined unambiguously via dual-path power detection of these recoupled orthogonal-polarimetric cladding modes ( LP ( 1 , 12 ) and LP ( 1 , 13 ) ) . Since spectral information is not required , temperature changes do not affect the sensor response , and power fluctuations can be referenced out by monitoring the power in the core mode ( LP ( 0 , 1 ) ) resonance .

__label__sciMet_Marine_Biology_&_Hydrobiology , The euphausiid Meganyctiphanes norvegica ( Northern Krill ) is predominantly an oceanic species common to the North Atlantic and adjacent seas . In the Kattegat the species concentrates in a series of depressions in the Kattegat Channel east of the island of Lsø which represent havens of marine conditions beneath the low salinity Baltic outflow . The vertical migratory behaviour of Meganyctiphanes results in it encountering considerable contrasts in physical conditions during its diurnal cycle . This behaviour and the resulting physical experience of the animals were investigated by means of a combination of net sampling and ADCP transects across the Alkor Deep ( 131 m ) in summer ( 18–19/7/96 ) and winter ( 9–10/3/97 ) . In both summer and winter the krill tended to concentrate within the basin during daytime and to disperse in the upper layers at night . The period of dispersion was longer in winter ( 17 . 00–05 . 00 h ) than in summer ( 23 . 00–02 . 00 h ) . The complex layering of different wind-induced and tidal current systems acted to advect the krill away from the basin during their upward phase at night . ADCP measurements showed that in summer the krill would be advected SSW at an average rate of 3 cm s-1 , but that in winter they would be advected WSW at 3 . 2 cm s-1 . Calculations show that the krill would be capable of swimming against such currents without increasing their standard metabolism and that their distribution in the vicinity of the basin seems to be determined more by biotic than by abiotic factors .

__label__sciMet_Biomedical_Engineering , We have been developing a remote monitoring system for patients with implanted artificial hearts . The remote monitoring system consists of two digital data links an electromagnetic transcutaneous digital-data transmission ( TDT ) system between an artificial heart controller inside the body and a mobile computer outside the body , and a public high-speed data transmission service using PHS ( Personal Handy-Phone System ) between the mobile computer and a host computer in a hospital . The TDT system mainly consists of an ASK ( Amplitude Shift Keying ) circuit with carrier electromagnetic wave frequencies of 4MHz and 10 MHz and corresponding demodulation circuit , thin loop coil antennas for transmission and receiving , and a one-chip microcomputer for the alarm system for indicating misalignment of antennas outside the transmittable range to ensure error-free data transmission . In our remote monitoring system , motor current and motor rotational angle data from the implanted controller are framed together by a control code for data error checking and correcting at the receiving site , and the data are sent through the PHS connected to the mobile computer . GPS ( Global Positioning System ) positioning data are also sent to the host computer with control codes . The host computer calculates pump outflow and arterial pressure and displays the data in real-time waveforms . The host computer also displays the patient ' s position on the map and the condition of the batteries . The results of this study showed that the driving condition of the artificial heart and the subject ' s position could be remotely monitored on the host computer . It could be concluded that this monitoring system is useful for remote monitoring of patients with an implanted artificial heart .

__label__sciMet_Meteorology_&_Atmospheric_Sciences , A long-standing problem in large-eddy simulations ( LES ) of the planetary boundary layer ( PBL ) is that the mean wind and temperature profiles differ from the Monin-Obukhov similarity forms in the surface layer . This shortcoming of LES has been attributed to poor grid resolution and inadequate sub-grid-scale ( SGS ) modeling . We study this deficiency in PBL LES solutions calculated over a range of shear and buoyancy forcing conditions . The discrepancy from similarity forms becomes larger with increasing shear and smaller buoyancy forcing , and persists even with substantial horizontal grid refinement . With strong buoyancy forcing , however , the error is negligible . In order to achieve better agreement between LES and similarity forms in the surface layer , a two-part SGS eddy-viscosity model is proposed . The model preserves the usual SGS turbulent kinetic energy formulation for the SGS eddy viscosity , but it explicitly includes a contribution from the mean flow and a reduction of the contributions from the turbulent fluctuations near the surface . Solutions with the new model yield increased fluctuation amplitudes near the surface and better correspondence with similarity forms out to a distance of 0 . 1–0 . 2 times the PBL depth , i . e . , a typical surface-layer depth . These results are also found to be independent of grid anisotropy . The new model is simple to implement and computationally inexpensive .

__label__sciMet_Industrial_Engineering_&_Automation , Coordinate measuring machine ( CMM ) has been extensively used in surface measurement and inspection . CMM produces more accurate and reliable results compared with non-contact measurement devices , since CMM measures target surfaces in a tactile way and is not affected by surface reflection quality . However , when there is porosity on the outside surfaces , CMM measurement will have errors because part of the probing stylus will come into the porosity spaces . This paper presents a method of using CMM to measure external profiles of objects with external porosity spaces . The center of a CMM probing stylus will be compensated to avoid porosity spaces and located above external surface areas along surface normal directions . Such a probing strategy can be implemented in both computer-aided design ( CAD ) -guided mode and non-CAD-guided mode . When the CAD model is available , the probing styli are guided to approach the surface along its normal directions successively to identify and avoid porosity spaces . When the CAD model is unavailable , surface normal directions will be estimated first and then adjusted . The presented method is able to avoid porosity spaces in CMM measurement regardless of the availability of CAD models . Measuring external profiles of porous objects using CMM
__label__sciMet_Organic_Chemistry , A robust convergent synthesis of the prodrugs of HCV replicase inhibitors 1-5 is described . The central 5H-imidazo[4 , 5-d]pyridazine core was formed from acid-catalyzed cyclocondensation of an imidazole-4 , 5-dicarbaldehyde ( 20 ) and a α-hydrazino ester , generated in situ from the bis-BOC-protected precursors 25 and 33 . The acidic conditions not only released the otherwise unstable α-hydrazino esters but also were the key to avoid facile decarboxylation to the parent drugs from the carboxylic ester prodrugs 1-5 . The bis-BOC α-hydrazino esters 25 and 33 were prepared by addition of ester enolates ( from 23 and 32 ) to di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate via catalysis with mild inorganic bases , such as Li2CO3 .

__label__sciMet_General_Chemistry , Proton coupled electron transfer ( PCET ) from tyrosine covalently linked to Ru ( bpy ) 32+ has been studied with laser flash-quench techniques . Two new complexes with internal hydrogen bonding bases to the phenolic proton have been synthesized . Depending on the hydrogen bonding and protonation situation the rate constant of PCET spanned over 5 orders of magnitude and revealed a systematic dependence on pH . This resulted in a previously predicted rate ladder scheme ( i ) pH dependent concerted electron-proton transfer ( CEP ) with deprotonation to bulk water , giving low PCET rates , ( ii ) pH independent CEP with deprotonation to the internal base , giving intermediate PCET rates , and ( iii ) pure electron transfer from tyrosinate , giving high rates . This behavior is reminiscent of Yz oxidation in Mn-depleted and native photosystem II . The study also revealed important differences in rates between phenols with strong and weak hydrogen bonds , and for the latter a hydrogen bond-gated PCET was observed .

__label__sciMet_Inorganic_&_Nuclear_Chemistry , A novel selective fluorescent chemosensor based on an 8-hydroxyquinoline-appended fluorescein derivative ( L1 ) was synthesized and characterized . Once combined with Cu ( 2+ ) , it displayed high specificity for sulfide anion . Among the various anions , only sulfide anion induced the revival of fluoresecence of L1 , which was quenched by Cu ( 2+ ) , resulting in off-on-type sensing of sulfide anion . What ' s more , the sensor was retrievable to indicate sulfide anions with Cu ( 2+ ) , and S ( 2- ) , in turn , increased . With the addition of Cu ( 2+ ) , compound L1 could give rise to a visible pink-to-yellow color change and green fluorescence quenching . The resulting yellow solution could change to pink and regenerate to green fluorescence immediately upon the addition of sulfide anion however , no changes were observed in the presence of other anions , including CN ( - ) , P ( 2 ) O ( 7 ) ( 4- ) , and other forms of sulfate , making compound L1 an extremely selective and efficient sulfide chemosensor .

Topology control is the capability of a node to control the set of neighbor nodes . In this paper , the impact of using smart antennas and/or power control for topology control is investigated and the performance of TDMA MAC schemes with common frame , for which the assignment of time slots to a node is not aware of the time slots assigned to the neighbor nodes ( topology-unaware ) , is studied . A comparison based on analytical models reveals the advantages of topology control , as well as its dependence on the mobility of the nodes and its resolution . Simulation results support the claims and the expectations of the analysis and show how the performance under topology control can be increased and how mobility affects it .

__label__sciMet_Evolutionary_Biology , The Old World fossil record of the family Camelidae is patchy , but a new partial cranium and some other remains of Camelus grattardi from the Mille-Logya Project area in the Afar , Ethiopia , greatly increase the fossil record of the genus in Africa . These new data – together with analysis of unpublished and recently published material from other sites , and reappraisal of poorly known taxa – allow for a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis showing that C . grattardi is the earliest ( 2 . 2–2 . 9 Ma ) and most basal species of the genus . We also show that the lineages leading to the extant taxa C . dromedarius and C . bactrianus diverged much higher in the tree , suggesting a recent age for this divergence . A late divergence date between the extant species is consistent with the absence of any fossil forms that could be ancestral , or closely related , to any of the extant forms before the late Pleistocene , but stands in contrast to molecular estimates which place the divergence between the dromedary and the Bactrian camel between 8 and 4 million years ago .

__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , Heading date is one of the importance agronomic traits . A library consisting of 1 , 123 single segment substitution lines ( SSSLs ) in the same genetic background of an elite rice variety Huajingxian 74 ( HJX74 ) was evaluated for heading date ( HD ) . From this library , the SSSL W06-26-35-1-5-2 with the substituted interval of PSM152–PSM154–PSM155–RM25–RM547–RM72–RM404 was found having a gene , which performed stable and late heading in the different environments of Shandong and Hainan provinces . To map the gene governing heading date , the SSSL W06-26-35-1-5-2 was crossed with the recipient HJX74 to develop an F2 segregating population . The distribution of late and early heading plants in this population fitted a segregation ratio of 3 1 , indicating the late heading was controlled by a dominant gene . The gene locus for heading date was tentatively designated as qHD8-1 . Using a random sample of 460 individuals from the F2 population , the qHD8-1 was narrowed down to a region flanking by two SSR markers PSM155 and RM547 . For fine mapping of qHD8-1 , a large F2 3 segregating population of 3 , 000 individuals were developed from F2 plants heterozygous in the PSM155–RM547 region . Recombinants analysis further mapped qHD8-1 to an interval of region 26 kb with markers RM22492 and P23 bounded on the left and right sides , respectively . Sequence analysis of this 26-kb fragment revealed that it contains five putative open reading frames , which were regarded as candidates of qHD8-1 . These results will be useful in cloning of the qHD8-1 gene . Fine Mapping of qHD8-1 , a QTL Controlling the Heading Date , to a 26-kb DNA Fragment in Rice ( Oryza sativa L . ) 
__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , We examined changes in a poly ( ethylene oxide ) ( PEO ) coating by continuously monitoring the electroosmotic flow ( EOF ) in a fused-silica capillary during electrophoresis . An imaging CCD camera was used to follow the motion of a fluorescent neutral marker zone along the length of the capillary . The PEO coating was shown to reduce the velocity of EOF by more than 1 order of magnitude compared to a bare capillary at pH 7 . 0 . However , it did not reduce EOF efficiently at pH 8 . 2 . The coating protocol was important , especially at an intermediate pH of 7 . 7 . Capillary reconditioning with an acidified solution of PEO was necessary in order to create a stable and efficient coating . In all cases we observed a gradual increase of EOF during extended runs , suggesting that the coating is slowly being degraded . The increase of pH in the cathodic ( detection-end ) buffer reservoir beyond pH ∼8 . 0 , e . g . , as a result of electrolysis , had a large impact on the stability of the coating . This phenomenon may be used for the efficient and fast regeneration of the column surface and provides a simpler and more reliable alternative to pressure flushing of the capillary .

__label__sciMet_Geochemistry_&_Geophysics , Prismatic wave is that it has three reflection paths and two reflection points , one of which is located at the reflection interface and the other is located at the steep dip angle reflection layer , so that contains a lot of the high and steep reflection interface information that primary cannot reach . Prismatic wave field information can be separated by applying Born approximation to traditional reverse time migration profile , and then the prismatic wave is used to update velocity to improve the inversion efficiency for the salt dame flanks and some other high and steep structure . Under the guidance of this idea , a prismatic waveform inversion method is proposed ( abbreviated as PWI ) . PWI has a significant drawback that an iteration time of PWI is more than twice as that of FWI , meanwhile , the full wave field information cannot all be used , for this problem , we propose a joint inversion method to combine prismatic waveform inversion with full waveform inversion . In this method , FWI and PWI are applied alternately to invert the velocity . Model tests suggest that the joint inversion method is less dependence on the high and steep structure information in the initial model and improve high inversion efficiency and accuracy for the model with steep dip angle structure . Prismatic and full-waveform joint inversion
__label__sciMet_Mechanical_Engineering_&_Transports , The authors are to be congratulated for presenting some aspects of a complex problem regarding possible mechanisms in face seals operation . Much effort is being devoted lately towards a better understanding of these mechanisms . Experimental work such as this reported by the authors is essential for that aim . Some remarks concerning the test procedure and the conclusions may be helpful in further experiments of this kind . The initial waviness measured by probe A while the spindle is slowly rotated can be misleading unless the gimbals motion is substracted . Gimbals tracing would eliminate first mode waviness which may be present on the rotor surface . On the other hand , if such first mode does not exist then the tendency of the gimbals to make three points contact between rotor and stator will result in an appearance of false first mode wave . The measurement of rotor surface waviness during operation is also affected by the gimbals motion . This measurement is not complete without an accurate knowledge of the exact motion of the gimbals . The authors explain discrepancies between theory and experimental observation by the gimbals inertia which would not allow perfect tracking , and hence eliminating of first harmonic due to tilt . However , even with inertialess gimbals perfect tracking cannot be achieved because of a hydrodynamic transverse moment acting at 90 degrees out of phase from the tilt [16] . As a matter of fact it can be shown that angular misalignment of the stator would cause it to wobble at a frequency that is half the rotor speed . Indeed a wobble of such subharmonic nature was observed by the discussor on the very same apparatus when the glass stator was tilted by means of an eccentric load . In conclusion , although TEI may affect seal ' s operation it is felt that the dynamics of seal motion is the key factor in studying seal stability . This motion should be carefully monitored and analyzed in any further experimentation . Authors ' closure
__label__sciMet_Applied_Physics , AbstractThe deviation y from stoichiometry of Cd1+y ( Sx Se1−x ) single crystals was controlled through the vapor growth process by regulating the sum of chalcogen partial pressure $$P_{ps} ( = P_{S_{\text{2}} } + P_{Se_{\text{2}} } ) $$ , and by keeping the pressure ratio $$P_r ( = P_{S_{\text{2}} } /P_{Se_{\text{2}} } ) $$ constant in each vapor growth experiment . The dark electrical conductivity changed 10 orders of magnitude from low to high resistivity with increasing Pps · However , the photoluminescence ( PL ) intensity did not show the obvious change and decreased gradually with increasing Pps These results can be explained by an increase of acceptor-type native defects such as cadmium vacancy Vcd with increasing Pps and it was confirmed that the deviation y from stoichiometry is effectively controlled under Pps higher that Pps =10 Torr , The vapor transport mechanism was also discussed .

__label__sciMet_Physical_Chemistry , Advanced hybrid fibrous materials based on polyacrylonitrile ( PAN ) and CuS/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals ( NCs ) were successfully prepared as efficient visible-light photocatalysts . The first step in the development of these novel hybrids was the synthesis of CuS/ZnS core/shell NCs with high photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation . Further , CuS/ZnS–in–PAN hybrids were fabricated by electrospinning of PAN and CuS/ZnS NCs mixture , resulted in the distribution of NCs mainly into the PAN fibers . Purposefully , by simultaneous electrospinning of PAN solution and electrospraying of CuS/ZnS NCs dispersion , CuS/ZnS–on–PAN hybrids were obtained , as well . Thus , in one-step , NCs were selectively deposited “in” the PAN fibers or “on” the surface along the length of PAN fibers . The morphology of the hybrid materials was observed by scanning electron microscopy , while the distribution and crystallinity of the CuS/ZnS NCs were determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscope equipped with the selected area electron diffraction . The prepared CuS/ZnS–in–PAN and CuS/ZnS–on–PAN hybrids exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity even after threefold use in degradation of Rhodamine B under visible-light irradiation . Thus , the electrospun fibrous hybrids are very promising for design of a visible-light photoreactors for waste water treatment .

__label__sciMet_Geological_&_Geomatics_Engineering , Abstract We describe and validate an improved endmember extraction method to improve the fractional snow-cover mapping based on the algorithm for fast autonomous spectral endmember determination ( N-FINDR ) maximizing volume iteration algorithm and orthogonal subspace projection theory . A spectral library time series is first established by choosing the expected spectra information using prior knowledge , and the fractional snow cover ( FSC ) is then retrieved by a fully constrained least squares linear spectral mixture analysis . The retrieved fractional snow-cover products are validated by the FSC derived from Landsat imagery . Our results indicate that the improved algorithm can obtain the endmember information accurately , and the retrieved FSC has better accuracy than the MODIS standard fractional snow-cover product ( MOD10A1 ) .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , Melamine and its derivatives ( i . e . , ammeline , ammelide , and cyanuric acid ) are extensively used in household products , such as furniture , dinnerware , and food utensils . Nevertheless , limited information is available on human exposures , other than dietary sources , to melamine and its derivatives . In this study , the occurrence of melamine and its derivatives was determined , for the first time , in 341 samples of indoor dust , collected from 12 countries . All of the dust samples contained target analytes , with global median concentrations of 1800 , 1100 , 48 , and 45 ng/g for melamine , cyanuric acid , ammelide , and ammeline , respectively . The total concentrations of melamine and its derivatives varied among countries in the following decreasing order United States ( median 17 000 ng/g ) > Japan ( 8400 ) > China ( 8000 ) > South Korea ( 7300 ) > Saudi Arabia ( 4400 ) > Romania ( 4300 ) > Greece ( 3400 ) > Kuwait ( 2400 ) > Vietnam ( 2300 ) > Colombia ( 1300 ) > Pakistan ( 820 ) > India ( 430 ) . Correlation analysis indicated the existence of multiple and varied sources for melamine and cyanuric acid . Estimated daily intakes of melamine via indoor dust ingestion were at least 2 orders of magnitude below the current tolerable daily intake .

__label__sciMet_Mechanical_Engineering_&_Transports , The shape recovery and shape fixity properties of shape memory polymers ( SMPs ) , advanced functional materials , were investigated in this study . Although the shape recovery behavior of these polymers has been examined from a viscoelastic point of view , questions remain with regard to quantifying the recovery behavior of SMPs . SMPs can recover their shape after the molding process this recovery occurs via creep recovery and/or shape recovery an estimation of SMP recovery requires a good understanding of both processes . In this study , the time–temperature superposition principle was applied to the creep and shape recovery behavior of SMPs . The creep behavior was estimated using an experimentally obtained master curve and time–temperature shift factors . Our estimated results were in good agreement with the experimental data . However , the estimation of the creep recovery with changing temperature below or above the glass transition temperature was not successful due to the lack of consideration of the shape recovery behavior . The time and temperature dependency of the shape recovery were confirmed for creep behavior , using the master curve for the recovery ratio and the corresponding shift factors for shape recovery . The values of the shape recovery shift factors differed from those for the time–temperature shift factors obtained for creep behavior . Therefore , these shape recovery shift factors were used in the estimation of creep and shape recovery behavior using the master curve for the creep tests . The estimated results were closer to the results obtained experimentally . Moreover , our results indicated that the recovery behavior above Tg$T_{\mathrm{g}}$ was dominated by shape recovery as a result of polymer viscoelasticity .

__label__sciMet_Entomology , Few studies have documented the indirect effects of predators on tick behavior . We conducted behavioral assays in the laboratory to quantify the effects of a highly abundant predator , the red imported fire ant ( Solenopsis invicta ) , on three species of ticks endemic to the southern USA the lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ) , the Gulf Coast tick ( A . maculatum ) , and the Cayenne tick ( A . mixtum ) . We documented ant aggression toward ticks ( biting , carrying , and stinging ) and determined the effects of ants on tick activity . Ticks were significantly less active in the presence of fire ants , and tick activity was negatively associated with ant aggression , but in many cases the effects of fire ants on ticks varied by tick species , stage , and engorgement status . For example , fire ants took half as long ( ~ 62 s ) to become aggressive toward unfed A . americanum adults compared with unfed A . maculatum , and only ~ 8 s to become aggressive toward engorged A . maculatum nymphs . Correspondingly , the activity of unfed A . americanum adults and engorged A . maculatum nymphs was reduced by 67 and 93% , respectively , in the presence of fire ants . This reduction in tick activity translated to less questing by unfed ticks and less time spent walking by engorged nymphs . Our results suggest that fire ants may have important non-consumptive effects on ticks and demonstrate the importance of measuring the indirect effects of predators on tick behavior . Red imported fire ant ( Solenopsis invicta ) aggression influences the behavior of three hard tick species
__label__sciMet_Applied_Physics , Decreasing the total lead content from Pb0 . 4 to Pb0 . 3 significantly stunts Bi-2223 phase development and greatly reduces the critical current density ( Jc ) of powder-in-tube tapes made by a two-powder process . This effect can be explained on the basis of the solubility limit for lead in 2212 . Pb0 . 4 samples exceed the solubility limit for lead in 2212 , so lead is rejected to create a lead-rich liquid that enhances the kinetics of 2223 formation during heat treatment . By contrast , a liquid does not form in the Pb0 . 3 sample because its lead content is below the solubility limit . As a result , 2223 formation is much slower and Jc is much lower in the Pb0 . 3 sample . Effect of lead content on Bi-2223 formation by a two-powder process
__label__sciMet_Artificial_Intelligence_&_Image_Processing , Differential evolution ( DE ) algorithm is widely used for solving real-parameter optimization problems due to its simplicity and efficiency . However the canonical DE is easy to suffer from the premature convergence . To further improve the performance of the DE , a differential evolution algorithm with dual preferred learning mutation ( DPLDE ) is proposed . Dual preferred learning mutation simultaneously learns behaviors from the individual with better fitness ( BFI ) and individual with better diversity ( BDI ) . The learning factor of BFI is self-adaptively and independently adjusted for each individual . The learning factor of BDI is adaptively adjusted at each generation . A total of 26 Benchmark test functions with different characteristics are used for performance comparative experiments . The results show that DPLDE is superior to the eight state-of-the-art improved algorithms in terms of the convergence precision , convergence speed and stability . For the high-dimensional functions , with the same-scale population and maximum number of evolution generations , DPLDE can still get the excellent global optimization performance and has a more prominent advantage .

__label__sciMet_Ecology , Landscape connectivity is considered important for species persistence , but linkages among landscape populations ( metalandscape connectivity ) may be necessary to ensure the long-term viability of some migratory songbirds at a broader regional scale . Because of regional source-sink dynamics , these species can maintain steady populations within extensively fragmented landscapes ( landscape sinks ) owing to high levels of immigration from source landscapes . We undertook a modeling study to identify the conditions under which immigration , an index of metalandscape connectivity , could rescue declining populations of songbirds in heavily disturbed landscapes . In general , low to moderate levels of immigration ( m = 0–20% ) were sufficient to rescue species with low edge-sensitivity in landscapes where<70% habitat had been destroyed . At the other extreme , moderate to high levels of immigration ( m = 11–40% ) were usually required to rescue highly edge-sensitive species in these same landscapes . Very high levels of immigration ( m>40% ) were required to rescue highly edge-sensitive species in extensively fragmented landscapes that had lost >50% habitat , or when any landscape lost ≥50% habitat gradually over a period of 100 or more years ( r = 0 . 5% habitat lost/year ) . Paradoxically higher levels of immigration were thus necessary to offset population declines when habitat was lost gradually than when it was lost quickly , where population response lagged behind landscape change . This implies that the importance of metalandscape connectivity for population viability may not be fully appreciated in landscapes undergoing rapid rates of change . Natural immigration rates for migratory songbirds match the very high levels ( >40% ) we found necessary to sustain populations in heavily disturbed landscapes , which underscores the importance of metalandscape connectivity for the continued persistence of many migratory songbirds in the face of widespread habitat loss and fragmentation .

__label__sciMet_Artificial_Intelligence_&_Image_Processing , Abstract We have developed an analytical approach for an artificial chemosensing system that is based directly on olfactory neural circuits . An array of chemosensors , with response properties similar to olfactory sensory neurons , provides time-varying inputs to a computer simulation of the olfactory bulb ( OB ) . The OB simulation produces spatio-temporal patterns of spiking that vary with odor type . These patterns are then recognized by a delay line neural network ( DLNN ) . After OB–DLNN processing , odor identity is encoded by activity across DLNN units , and odor intensity is encoded by response latency , enabling discrimination among organic vapors over a range of concentrations .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , In this paper , the possibility of reusing textile effluents for new dyeing baths has been investigated . For this purpose , different trichromies using Direct Red 80 , Direct Blue 106 , and Direct Yellow 98 on cotton have been used . Effluents have been treated by means of a photo-Fenton process at pH 5 . Addition of humic-like substances isolated form urban wastes is necessary in order to prevent iron deactivation because of the formation of non-active iron hydroxides . Laboratory-scale experiments carried out with synthetic effluents show that comparable results were obtained when using as solvent water treated by photo-Fenton with SBO and fresh deionized water . Experiments were scaled up to pilot plant illuminated under sunlight , using in this case a real textile effluent . Decoloration of the effluent could be achieved after moderate irradiation and cotton dyed with this water presented similar characteristics as when deionized water was used .

__label__sciMet_Chemical_Engineering , Experimental data have been obtained and an analysis has been performed of the degree of crystallinity and amorphism and the state of water for cellulose acetate membranes using the methods of X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetry . The degree of crystallinity , as well as the crystallite size , have been determined in the membrane samples before and after water absorption . It has been found that OH groups of cellulose acetate form a nonequilibrium network of hydrogen bonds between molecules and fragments in the amorphous phase of an air-dry semipermeable membrane . It has been shown that water that acts as a plasticizer causes the ordering of the macromolecular amorphous phase , which leads to a transition into the liquid crystal phase with the formation of additional capillary spaces .

__label__sciMet_Applied_Physics , Many radiation hardened by design ( RHBD ) latch architectures have been presented in the literature . These architectures are designed such that these can tolerate a charged particle impact at multiple nodes of the latch . These architectures differ in terms of approach for developing single event upset ( SEU ) tolerance , area and other parameters . The literature survey and SEU fault simulation study reveal that some of the architectures have SEU critical internal node pairs while most of the architectures exhibit single point failure at input data node . In this work , SEU mechanisms in RHBD latches are analyzed and a new rule-based design is proposed for designing latches which can tolerate multiple nodes upset . Critical charge ( $\text{Q}_{crit}$ ) of the proposed latch architecture is found significantly higher than most of double node upset tolerant latches published . Area requirement , power consumption , and performance of the proposed latch are found comparable with the latches of same class . The proposed rule-based design methodology may become helpful in developing a computer-aided design tool for synthesis of multiple nodes upset tolerant latch .

__label__sciMet_Entomology , The relationship between utilized and available resources in the same environment has not yet been studied in most wild bees . In a riparian forest , a total of 15 pollen types from 10 plant families were identified from pollen provisions of 17 nests of the wood-dwelling Augochlora amphitrite ( Hymenoptera Halictidae ) for which only floral records have been known . During the foraging period , only five out of 108 available flowering species were visited intensively ( more than 10 % ) for pollen . As more than three families and 32 . 2 % of the available plant families were visited for pollen , the broad polylecty category was inferred . Like in other Augochlora species , a variety of floral types was visited by A . amphitrite , in agreement with its broadly polylectic foraging habit . The selection index was positive for the highly abundant Ludwigia ( Onagraceae ) and the rare Gymnocoronis spilanthoides ( Asteraceae ) . The intensive foraging on Ludwigia could indicate temporary specialization for this abundant pollen resource . The tendency of this bee to visit intensively one flower type for pollen suggests that bee individuals had to learn to handle this abundant flower type . Pollen analysis complemented with field observations on floral resource availability proved to be helpful tools to provide information on the foraging behaviour of a wild bee in its natural environment . Pollen host selection by a broadly polylectic halictid bee in relation to resource availability
__label__sciMet_Astronomy_&_Astrophysics , In the bounds of the totally nonmetric model of gravitational interaction theory ( gravidynamics ) the strong field of a compact object ( a collapsar ) — an analogue to the black hole in general relativity — is investigated . In the case of utmost strong ( for gravidynamics ) collapsar , field a region filled , by matter ( a bag ) must have the radius equal tor*=GM/c2≲10 km at the total collapsar massM≲7M⊙ . Only half of the collapsar mass is contained in the bag , the other one of its total energy ( Mc2 ) is distributed in the space surrounding the bag in the form of ‘a coat’ , i . e . , in the form of continuous medium ( a relativistic ‘gas’ ) of virtual gravitons . The object must have the surface ( the bag surface ) with absolutely definite physical properties . The potential of such a surface is finite ( ϕ+=-c2/2 ) and the particle mass finding itself in a bound state on the bag surface is two times less than the mass of the same particle in a totally free state . The bag surface can perform periodic oscillations ( pulsations ) with the periodGM/c2≈3×10−5 s . An energy density inside the bag with the utmost strong gravitational field or with an utmost dense ‘coat’ shrouding the bag is determined by gravitation theory constants only and depends on the distance to the bag centerr in the following way ε ( r ) = ( c5/8πG ) r−2 . The bag matter in the case is most probably in the state of quark-gluon plasma . The properties of the strong static field of a collapsar in gravidynamics

__label__sciMet_Entomology , Abstract . Males of several insect species inflict wounds on female genitalia during copulation , but the significance of such copulatory wounds for males is not clear . I compared the genitalia of virgin and mated Formica japonica females and for the first time report the occurrence of copulatory wounds in this monandrous ant species . All inseminated females examined had two types of melanized patches , indicating wound repair , and the serrated penis valves and sharp-pointed volsellar digitus of male genitalia were the likely instruments of these wounds . Physically damaging mating in monandrous species supports the view that copulatory wounds do not necessarily contribute to postcopulatory fitness gains for males via advantages in sperm competition or cryptic female choice .

__label__sciMet_Analytical_Chemistry , Prostate cancer ( PCa ) is a leading cause of cancer-related death among males globally . To date , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , as a typical tumour marker , has been widely used in the early diagnosis of PCa . However , in practical clinical tests , high serum levels of PSA show a high probability for false-positive results , leading to misdiagnoses . In this study , we developed a new classification system for PCa , benign prostate hyperplasia ( BPH ) and healthy subjects by using a surface-enhanced Raman scattering ( SERS ) -based immunoassay of multiple tumour markers along with a support vector machine ( SVM ) algorithm . Silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs ) as immune probes and SiC@Ag@Ag-NPs SERS as immune substrates were constructed into a sandwich structure to serve as an ultrasensitive SERS-based immunoassay platform of tumour markers . With this assay , the limits of detection for PSA , prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) and human kallikrein 2 ( hK2 ) were as low as 0 . 46 fg mL-1 , 1 . 05 fg mL-1 and 0 . 67 fg mL-1 , respectively . Furthermore , the serum levels of PSA , PSMA and hK2 in clinical samples were successfully detected using the SERS-based immunoassay platform , and correct classifications of PCa , BPH and healthy subjects were feasible with help of the linear SVM algorithm . These results demonstrate the potential for improving the diagnostic accuracy of PCa . Overall , the linear SVM classification model with multiple tumour markers exhibited good classifications of PCa , BPH and healthy subjects , with a PCa diagnostic accuracy of 70% that was significantly superior to that of the linear SVM classification model based only on the serum level of PSA ( 50% ) . Therefore , combining the SERS-based immunoassay with pattern recognition technology can allow for comprehensive analyses of the serum levels of multiple tumour markers to effectively improve the diagnostic accuracy of cancer with potential applications in point-of-care testing .

__label__sciMet_Evolutionary_Biology , As an equilibrium refinement of the Nash equilibrium , evolutionarily stable strategy ( ESS ) is a key concept in evolutionary game theory and has attracted growing interest . An ESS can be either a pure strategy or a mixed strategy . Even though the randomness is allowed in mixed strategy , the selection probability of pure strategy in a mixed strategy may fluctuate due to the impact of many factors . The fluctuation can lead to more uncertainty . In this paper , such uncertainty involved in mixed strategy has been further taken into consideration a belief strategy is proposed in terms of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory . Furthermore , based on the proposed belief strategy , a belief-based ESS has been developed . The belief strategy and belief-based ESS can reduce to the mixed strategy and mixed ESS , which provide more realistic and powerful tools to describe interactions among agents .

__label__sciMet_Ecology , Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration can increase biomass production and alter tissue composition . Shifts in both quantity and quality of crop residue may alter carbon ( C ) and nitrogen ( N ) dynamics and management considerations in future CO2-enriched agroecosystems . This study was conducted to determine decomposition rates of the legume soybean [Glycine max ( L . ) Merr . ] and nonlegume grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor ( L . ) Moench . ] residue produced under two levels of atmospheric CO2 ( ambient and twice ambient ) on a Blanton loamy sand ( loamy siliceous , thermic , Grossarenic Paleudults ) in Auburn , Alabama , USA , managed using no-till practices . At maturity , harvested plants were separated into component parts for dry weight determination and tissue analysis . Mass , C , and N losses from residues were determined using the mesh bag method . Biomass production was significantly greater for soybean compared to sorghum and for elevated versus ambient CO2-grown plants . The CO2 level had little affect on the C/N ratio of residue ( probably because the tissue used was senesced ) . Elevated CO2 concentration did not affect percent residue recovery however , greater biomass production observed under elevated CO2 resulted in more residue and C remaining after overwintering . The higher total N content of soybean residue , particularly when grown under elevated CO2 , indicated more N may be available to a following crop with lower N inputs required . Results suggest that in a high CO2 environment , greater amounts of residue may increase soil C and ground cover , which may enhance soil water storage , improve soil physical properties , and reduce erosion losses .

__label__sciMet_Chemical_Physics , Multipole ( MTP ) electrostatics provides the means to describe anisotropic interactions in a rigorous and systematic manner . A number of earlier molecular dynamics ( MD ) implementations have increasingly relied on the use of molecular symmetry to reduce the ( possibly large ) number of MTP interactions . Here , we present a CHARMM implementation of MTP electrostatics in terms of spherical harmonics . By relying on a systematic set of reference-axis systems tailored to various chemical environments , we obtain an implementation that is both efficient and scalable for ( bio ) molecular systems . We apply the method to a series of halogenated compounds to show ( i ) energy conservation ( ii ) improvements in reproducing thermodynamic properties compared to standard point-charge ( PC ) models ( iii ) performance of the code and ( iv ) better stabilization of a brominated ligand in a target protein , compared to a PC force field .

__label__sciMet_Medicinal_&_Biomolecular_Chemistry , Pediatric drug research is still substandard , not reaching the same quality level as adult drug research . Despite the efforts made by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency to reduce off-label use in children , the lack of clinical studies involving the pediatric population still stands . Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies ( PK/PD ) taking growth and maturation into account are necessary to rationalize dosing strategies in children . Currently , traditional animal models such as rats , mice , dogs and primates are used to conduct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies , however age-related trials are rather uncommon . Moreover , these species have several shortcomings as animal models , such as a different physiology and anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract in dogs or the ethical aspects for the use of primates . In contrast , piglets might be potential biomedical pediatric animal models because of the good resemblance with humans , anatomically , physiologically and biochemically .

McLachlan writes in an easy fl owing style , making the book a great read . Th e missing element that she sometimes tantalizes the reader with is the larger structural dynamics at work both in the initial creation of these communities and their subsequent fate . I speak , for example , of the deliberate settlement of the Canadian Plains as part of an industrialization strategy and then the deliberate radical transformation of that strategy fostering depopulation under the pressures of globalization . McLachlan hints at the dynamics of centralization and corporate growth ( 204 ) , changing federal government policy such as abandoning the oncenecessary infrastructure ( 203 ) however , these insights remain undeveloped . Additionally , I longed for some comment on the key actors or agents in the changes she describes , and how they organized the various interests in the community to undertake the actions that she describes . But these are the quibbles of a sociologist always wanting analysis of power and the detailed dynamics of social and community change . Ukrainian nationalists’ model of a multiethnic society won the day in the postwar period as in the prewar one . Indeed all three groups pointed to the signifi cance of ethnicity in Canadian society by using oldworld symbols and myths that were increasingly tied to Canada . As a result , mainstream/ethnic boundaries declined in Canadian society “as the thinking of ethnic and mainstream elites coalesced and multiculturalism became a more integral part of Canadian identity” ( 184 ) . Fujiwara has done a commendable job at craft ing her arguments and supporting them with a vast array of documentary evidence— English , Ukrainian , and Japaneselanguage newspapers , and personal and ethnicsociety manuscript collections from across Canada . Th is volume will interest those readers who wish to understand the negotiations that persisted between ethnic and mainstream elites and led to an identity shift in English Canada in the 1960s .

__label__sciMet_Medicinal_&_Biomolecular_Chemistry , We have found that the deoxypodophyllotoxin-5-fluorouracil conjugate , 4 ' -O-demethyl-4-deoxyppodophyllotoxin-4 ' -yl 4- ( ( 6- ( 2- ( 5-fluorouracil-yl ) acetamido ) hexyl ) amino ) -4-oxobutanoate ( C069 ) , possessed superior cytotoxicities and less toxicity compared with etoposide . In this paper , the anti-angiogenic and vascular disrupting activities of C069 were examined with several in vitro and in vivo models . First , we demonstrated that C069 significantly inhibited the proliferation , migration , tube formation and disrupted the formed tube-like structures of HUVE cells , and inhibited angiogenesis in chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay . Furthermore , we found that C069 inhibited tube formation of HUVE cells by down-regulating the MMP-2 , MMP-9 , and phosphorylation of Akt and β-catenin . These results provided the initial evidence that C069 exerts potent anti-angiogenic and vascular disrupting effects . Investigation of the anti-angiogenesis effects induced by deoxypodophyllotoxin-5-FU conjugate C069 against HUVE cells . 
__label__sciMet_Plant_Biology_&_Botany , North Dakota leads the United States in canola ( Brassica napus L . ) production ( 4 ) . A canola field with a distinct patch of dead plants spreading over an area of approximately 0 . 4 ha was detected in Cavalier County , North Dakota , in early September 2013 . Numerous spots within the patch had plant mortalities >80% . Dead plants pulled from the soil had roots with severe galling and clubbing . Clubbed roots were brittle and disintegrated easily when pressed between fingers . Root and soil samples collected at several locations within and outside the affected patch were pooled in separate groups . All plants collected in the patch were symptomatic but those collected outside were not . In the lab , total genomic DNA from three symptomatic and two healthy root samples was extracted using standard procedures and freehand slices were prepared for observation with a compound microscope . Also , DNA from pooled soil samples was extracted using FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil ( MP Biomedicals , Solon , OH ) . Round resting structures ranging from 2 . 2 to 4 . 2 μm in diameter were observed by microscopic examination of symptomatic root tissues . These structures resembled those typically produced by Plasmodiophora brassicae Woronin . This initial identification was later confirmed through PCR analysis using the species specific primers TC1F/R and TC2F/R ( 1 ) . PCR products of 548 bp ( TC1F/R ) and 519 bp ( TC2F/R ) were produced in the three symptomatic and two infested soil samples , confirming the presence of P . brassicae . PCR amplicons were not detected in healthy root and soil samples . Pathogenicity tests were conducted in greenhouse to fulfill Koch ' s postulates . Briefly , five square plastic pots ( 10 × 10 × 13 cm ) were filled with a 10-cm layer of Sunshine Mix #1 potting mix ( Fison Horticulture , Vancouver , BC , Canada ) and then 1 g of ground root galls ( approximately 5 × 105 resting spores ) was spread evenly on its surface and covered with 2 cm of soilless mix . A similar number of pots were filled only with soilless mix and used as controls . All pots were planted with two seeds of canola cv . Westar and incubated in greenhouse conditions at 21°C and 16 h light daily . The experiment was conducted twice . Four weeks after planting , all plants in the inoculated pots had developed galls while plants in control pots were symptomless . Presence of P . brassicae resting spores in the newly developed galls was confirmed by microscopic observations and PCR . Based on the symptoms , morphology of resting spores , PCR reactions , and pathogenicity tests , we confirm the presence of P . brassicae on canola . While P . brassicae has been reported as widespread in North America ( 2 ) , to our knowledge , this is the first report of clubroot on canola in North Dakota and the United States . Clubroot became the most important disease affecting canola production in central Alberta , Canada , within 5 years of its discovery in 2003 ( 3 ) since then , the disease has been detected in Saskatchewan and Manitoba ( 3 ) , Canadian provinces that share borders with North Dakota . Considering the difficulties in management of clubroot , measures should be initiated to limit the spread of the disease before it could pose a threat to United States canola production .

The first step of most color quantization techniques is to create a histogram of the colors in the truecolor image . The dramatic differences in time and space efficiency of various data structures used to represent truecolor image histograms are visually explored in 3D . Spatial subdivisions use buckets to store colors in a portion of the RGB cube . Linked lists are the typical data structure used for buckets we propose using red-black trees and treaps .

__label__sciMet_Medicinal_&_Biomolecular_Chemistry , A series of 6- ( N-linked , five-membered heteroaryl ) -2 ( 1H ) -quinolinone derivatives was synthesized and evaluated for cardiotonic activity . Most compounds were prepared by sulfuric acid catalyzed cyclization of an N- ( 4-heteroarylphenyl ) -3-ethoxypropenamide or by condensation of a 2-amino-5-heteroarylbenzaldehyde or -acetophenone derivative with the ylide derived from triethyl phosphonoacetate . In anesthetized dogs , 6-imidazol-1-yl-8-methyl-2 ( 1H ) -quinolinone ( 3 25 micrograms/kg ) produced a greater increase in cardiac contractility ( percentage increase in dP/dt max ) than alternative 6- ( five-membered heteroaryl ) -substituted analogues ( 4-8 ) . Introduction of 4-methyl ( 10 ) or 2 , 4-dimethyl ( 13 ) substituents into the imidazole ring of 3 produced a marked increase in inotropic activity , and these compounds were some 10 and 5 times more potent than milrinone . Most of these quinolinones also displayed positive inotropic effects ( decrease in QA interval ) in conscious dogs after oral administration ( 0 . 0625-1 mg/kg ) and in many cases ( 3 , 5-7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 16 ) there was little difference in activities at both the 1- and 3-h time points . Compound 13 ( 62 . 5 , 125 , 250 micrograms/kg po ) demonstrated dose-related cardiac stimulant activity which , in contrast to milrinone , was maintained over the whole 7-h test period . No changes in heart rate were detected at any dose level and compounds 3 , 9 , 10 , and 13 also displayed high selectivity for the stimulation of cardiac contractile force rather than heart rate in the Starling dog heart-lung preparation . Increases in dP/dt max of approximately 50% were accompanied by heart rate changes of less than 10 beats/minute . Physicochemical measurements gave a log P of 1 . 64 for 13 with pKa values of 7 . 13 +/- 0 . 04 and 11 . 5 +/- 0 . 2 for the imidazole and quinolinone moieties , respectively . X-ray structural analysis of 13 showed the imidazole and quinolinone rings at 52 degrees to one another in close agreement with the minimum-energy conformation ( 30 degrees ) suggested by PCILO calculations . 6- ( 2 , 4-Dimethylimidazol-1-yl ) -8-methyl-2- ( 1H ) -quinolinone ( 13 , UK-61 , 260 ) is currently undergoing phase II clinical evaluation in congestive heart failure patients . 2 ( 1H ) -quinolinones with cardiac stimulant activity . 2 .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , In this study , field measurements were conducted to estimate and characterize the atmospheric emission levels and profiles of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) from multiple industrial thermal processes . The emission levels and profiles of PCBs from five types of thermal processes at twenty-three plants were studied and compared with eight processes reported in our previous studies . Correlation analysis was preformed to identify a marker congener for emission of ΣPCB . A significant correlation was observed between congener CB-118 and ΣPCB ( R ( 2 ) =0 . 65 and p<0 . 01 ) , which suggests that CB-118 is a good marker congener for emission of ΣPCB . The profiles of PCBs emitted from the thirteen thermal processes were compared , and this information could be used for studying source-receptor relationships and identifying the specific sources of PCBs . To prioritize the sources for control , the concentrations of PCBs from thirteen industrial thermal sources were compared . The PCB concentrations from secondary zinc smelting and thermal wire reclamation were about one to three order magnitude higher than those of other sources , which suggests that these two sources be given priority in PCB source control . Finally , the atmospheric emission factors of PCBs from the thirteen industrial sources were summarized , and these data will be useful for developing an integrated emission inventory of PCBs . Atmospheric emission of polychlorinated biphenyls from multiple industrial thermal processes .

This classification fundamentally differentiates between “projecting methods” , where controllability is monitored during the process design to predict the trade-offs between design and control , and the “integrated-optimization methods” which solve the process design and the control-systems design at once within an optimization framework . The latter are revised categorizing them according to the methods to evaluate controllability and other related properties , the scope of the design problem , the treatment of uncertainties and perturbations , and finally , the type the optimization problem formulation and the methods for its resolution .

__label__sciMet_Environmental_Sciences , A bench-scale capture and recovery system to convert a low concentration organic gas to a liquid is described here . Adsorption of isobutane onto activated carbon fiber cloth ( ACFC ) followed by electrothermal desorption and subsequent liquefaction is demonstrated . Experimental conditions to condense desorbed isobutane were determined based on Dalton ' s law and Antoine ' s equation . Breakthrough curves for a gas stream containing 2000 ppm ( v ) isobutane in air adsorbing onto ACFC-15 demonstrate an adsorption capacity of 0 . 094 ± 0 . 017 g of isobutane/g of ACFC with >98% capture efficiency . The system described here utilizes two adsorbers , which operate cyclically to allow for continuous treatment of the isobutane . Adsorption followed by electrothermal desorption provided a concentration ratio of 240 , which facilitates condensation of the isobutane after compression and cooling and is an order of magnitude greater than what has been previously demonstrated .

In this study , we propose a user interface that assists the neurosurgeon to select the entry point of the procedure using an atlas which displays the risk of the different linear trajectories from the head surface skin to the target . The risk assignment is carried out in two main steps , a weighted sum which depends on the distance of a single voxel to other risk structures and a second criteria using fuzzy rules to take into account other qualities such as length , which is the main contribution of this work . As a result , we present risk maps of two targets and visualize the less risky trajectories according to the system .

__label__sciMet_Medicinal_&_Biomolecular_Chemistry , Human proteinase-activated receptor 2 ( PAR2 ) , a transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) , is an attractive target for a novel anticancer therapy , as it plays a critical role in cell migration and invasion . Selective PAR2 inhibitors therefore have potential as anti-metastatic drugs . Knowing that the natural product teleocidin A2 is able to inhibit PAR2 in tumor cells , the goal of the present study was to elaborate structure-activity relationships and to identify potent PAR2 inhibitors with lower activity against the adverse target , protein kinase C ( PKC ) . For this purpose , an efficient gram-scale total synthesis of indolactam V ( i . e . , the parent structure of all teleocidins ) was developed , and a library of derivatives was prepared . Some compounds were indeed found to exhibit high potency as PAR2 inhibitors at low nanomolar concentrations with improved selectivity ( relative to teleocidin A2 ) . The pseudopeptidic fragment bridging the C3 and C4 positions of the indole core proved to be essential for target binding , whereas activity and target selectivity depends on the substituents at N1 or C7 .

__label__sciMet_Nuclear_&_Particles_Physics , Characteristics of Z-pinch plasma radiation in the form of a double shell neon gas puff with outer plasma shell are investigated in the microsecond implosion mode . Experiments are performed using a GIT-12 mega-joule generator with load current doubler having a ferromagnetic core at implosion currents up to 5 MA . Conditions for matching of the nonlinear load with the mega-ampere current multiplier circuit are determined . The load parameters ( plasma shell characteristics and mass and geometry of gas puff shells ) are optimized on the energy supplied to the gas puff and n energy characteristics of radiation . It is established that the best modes of K-shell radiation in neon are realized for such radial distribution of the gas-puff material at which the compression velocity of the shell is close to a constant and amounts to 27–30 cm/μs . In these modes , up to 40% of energy supplied to the gas puff is converted into K-shell radiation . The reasons limiting the efficiency of the radiation source with increasing implosion current are analyzed . A modernized version of the energy supply from the current doubler to the Z-pinch is proposed .

We exploit a two-tone prior to steer the intermediate latent image towards a piece-wise constant image with only two distinct gray levels . This prior is helpful for the process of kernel estimation to overcome undesirable local minima , and it is not too restrictive to deblur text images with complex backgrounds . Our kernel estimation method comprises two stages , where we first employ contrast-enhancing two-tone prior and then use intermediate-value inhibition regularizer . The resulting optimization formulation is solved by half-quadratic splitting and alternating minimization techniques . The experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of achieving accurate results and compares well with the state-of-the-art . Text image deblurring via two-tone prior

__label__sciMet_General_Chemistry , Semen is the main vector for HIV transmission worldwide . Recently , a peptide fragment ( PAP ( 248-286 ) ) has been isolated from seminal fluid that dramatically enhances HIV infectivity by up to 4-5 orders of magnitude . PAP ( 248-286 ) appears to enhance HIV infection by forming amyloid fibers known as SEVI , which are believed to enhance the attachment of the virus by bridging interactions between virion and host-cell membranes . We have solved the atomic-level resolution structure of the SEVI precursor PAP ( 248-286 ) using NMR spectroscopy in SDS micelles , which serve as a model membrane system . PAP ( 248-286 ) , which does not disrupt membranes like most amyloid proteins , binds superficially to the surface of the micelle , in contrast to other membrane-disruptive amyloid peptides that generally penetrate into the core of the membrane . The structure of PAP ( 248-286 ) is unlike most amyloid peptides in that PAP ( 248-286 ) is mostly disordered when bound to the surface of the micelle , as opposed to the alpha-helical structures typically found of most amyloid proteins . The highly disordered nature of the SEVI peptide may explain the unique ability of SEVI amyloid fibers to enhance HIV infection as partially disordered amyloid fibers will have a greater capture radius for the virus than compact amyloid fibers . Two regions of nascent structure ( an alpha-helix from V262-H270 and a dynamic alpha/3 ( 10 ) helix from S279-L283 ) match the prediction of highly amyloidogenic sequences and may serve as nuclei for aggregation and amyloid fibril formation . The structure presented here can be used for the rational design of mutagenesis studies on SEVI amyloid formation and viral infection enhancement . NMR structure in a membrane environment reveals putative amyloidogenic regions of the SEVI precursor peptide PAP ( 248-286 ) .

__label__sciMet_Medical_Informatics , Psychometrics has recently undergone extensive criticism within the medical education literature . The use of quantitative measurement using psychometric instruments such as response scales is thought to emphasize a narrow range of relevant learner skills and competencies . Recent reviews and commentaries suggest that a paradigm shift might be presently underway . We argue for caution , in that the psychometrics approach and the quantitative account of competencies that it reflects is based on a rich discussion regarding measurement and scaling that led to the establishment of this paradigm . Rather than reflecting a homogeneous discipline focused on core competencies devoid of consideration of context , the psychometric community has a history of discourse and debate within the field , with an acknowledgement that the techniques and instruments developed within psychometrics are heuristics that must be used pragmatically .

__label__sciMet_Numerical_&_Computational_Mathematics , Active contour method is a powerful approach for object contour extraction . This paper presents a new object contour extraction method , which combines the level set evolution with the support value filter . It analyzes image under the least squares support vector machine ( LS-SVM ) framework and uses the support values to represent salient features underlying image . The Gaussian filter , used in conventional level set method to compute the edge indicator , is replaced by the support value filter deduced from the mapped LS-SVM . The level set evolution method is implemented on the feature image obtained by convolving the support value filter with the original image . Experiments are undertaken on the synthetic and real images . The experimental results demonstrate that the support value filter can provide a good estimate for the optimal step size in a gradient descent algorithm and the proposed method has advantages over the direct level set evolution method in converging speed and contour extraction accuracy .

Generally , incubation of tissue or intact plants with ethylene reduced the degree of polar auxin transport . Ethylene inhibited the movement of both auxins in stem tissue and IAA in petiole tissue of cotton . The effect of ethylene on auxin movement in cow-peas was more complex . Ethylene apparently inhibited transport in younger petiole and stem tissue , but stimulated the process to a small but significant degree in basal petiole segments . Ethylene , in some experiments , reduced C ( 14 ) ( auxin ) uptake . This reduction was consistently smaller than the inhibition of transport . Effects upon transport were observed when uptake was not different . Differences in uptake declined as the period of incubation with auxin was lengthened , but transport was inhibited for up to 23 hours . It is proposed that ethylene may , through its effect on transport , cause localized shortages and surpluses of auxin which in turn contribute to symptoms now associated with the response of sensitive species to ethylene . Effects of ethylene on auxin transport . 
__label__sciMet_Industrial_Engineering_&_Automation , We propose new sufficient conditions for saddle-node bifurcations in one- and twoparametric dynamical systems obtained with the parameter functionalization method , derive asymptotic formulas for the resulting solutions , and analyze their stability . As an application , we consider the synchronization problem for periodic oscillations of an autonomous Van der Pol generator under an external harmonic influence .

__label__sciMet_Medicinal_&_Biomolecular_Chemistry , A number of ( S ) - and ( R ) -2-[ ( 2-phenoxyethyl ) aminomethyl]-1 , 4-benzodioxanes unsubstituted or ortho monosubstituted at the phenoxy moiety were synthesized and tested in binding assays on the alpha ( 1a ) -AR , alpha ( 1b ) -AR , alpha ( 1d ) -AR and the 5-HT ( 1A ) receptor . The affinity values of the new compounds 1-16 were compared with those of the enantiomers of the 2 , 6-dimethoxyphenoxy analogue , the well-known alpha ( 1 ) antagonist WB4101 , finding that the unsubstituted derivative ( S ) -1 and the o-methyl , the o-t-butyl , the o-fluoro and the o-methoxy derivatives , ( S ) -2 , ( S ) -4 , ( S ) -8 and ( S ) -16 , respectively , display a significantly specific 5-HT ( 1A ) affinity , very close , with the exception of ( S ) -4 , to the almost nanomolar one of ( S ) -WB4101 . Otherwise , sensible affinity decreases were recorded for the three alpha ( 1 ) -AR subtypes . A classical quantitative structure-activity relationship ( Hansch ) analysis was successfully applied to compounds ( S ) -1 to ( S ) -16 and ( S ) -WB4101 to rationalize such binding data . QSAR study for a novel series of ortho monosubstituted phenoxy analogues of alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist WB4101 .

__label__sciMet_Mining_&_Metallurgy , Spark plasma sintering ( SPS ) is currently a major powder consolidation process with many advantages however , it is still largely limited to the processing of simple shapes such as discs due to its geometric restrictions . Alternatively , spark plasma extrusion ( SPE ) is a recently developed process that has superiority over SPS in terms of faster consolidation , generating products of extended geometries and potential grain refinement capabilities under applied current . So far , work on SPE has resulted in large temperature gradients within the extruding material with microstructural and properties in-homogeneities . The present paper reports on a novel approach ( thermal barrier concept ) that allows the SPE of materials with enhanced uniformity in terms of microstructures and properties . Both aluminum and aluminum-carbon nanotube composites have been successfully processed using this new approach . Spark Plasma Extrusion and the Thermal Barrier Concept
